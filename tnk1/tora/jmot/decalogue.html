<p>The Hebrew word, <i>dvarim</i>, is usually translated
&quot;commandments&quot; in the context of the Decalogue. The actual meaning is
closer to &quot;words,” as in &quot;These are the words that Moses addressed to
all Israel.&quot; (Deut.1.1), as indicated by the Greek <i>logos</i> in
Deca-logue. In order to emphasize their special status, I will refer to the ten
individual elements as &quot;Words.&quot; This article will deal with reading
the ten Words as a coherent text rather than a collection lacking internal
integrity. The goal of the analysis is to clarify the set of formal
relationships that lie at the heart of the Decalogue. I will refer to this set
of relationships as tabular logic.
<p>The basic aspect of tabular logic is derived from the fact that the Words
were written on two tablets. I take this to imply that there is a significant
division of some sort between the Words on one tablet and those on the other.
Generally, representations of the Decalogue have the first five Words on one
tablet and the next five on the second, so that each tablet is in fact like a
column in a table. Illustrations usually show the Words ordered on the tablets
like this:
<div align=center>

<p>(Actually, at best, this is a mirror representation. Since the tablets were
written in Hebrew, they should be represented from right to left, that is, the
columns should be reversed.) This format is so common that one might assume
that it is of biblical origin. In fact, there is no clear evidence as to how
the text was written on the tablets. We know only that the revelation at Mt.
Sinai was made up of ten units of speech, <i>dvarim</i>, and that they were
written on two separate stone tablets. No one but Moses is reported to have
seen the writing on the tablets. The first set was destroyed before anyone
could see them. Moses kept the second set in a box until it was placed in the
ark. It is not recorded that the second set was ever shown to anyone. So it
would seem that there is no way to determine definitively how the text appeared
on the tablets. In this article I will suggest that literary analysis of the
text points to the following arrangement: 
<div align=center>

<p>This format brings out the full significance of the Words being written on
two tablets. They are five sets of pairs composing a tabular text having components
of meaning both in the rows and in the columns. In fact, the underlying
multi-dimensional logic proves to be the paradigm for the organization of legal
texts, both in the Torah and in the Mishnah. Thus there were at least two who
&quot;saw&quot; the logic of the tablets, Moses and Rabbi Judah The Prince, the
author of the Mishnah. It would appear that the inherent logic of the tablets
was part of the body of esoteric knowledge that was transmitted to but a few in
each generation. This would explain the fact that both the author of the <i>Tosefta</i>
and some of the speakers in the <i>Mechilta</i> were apparently ignorant of its
existence, while the author of <i>Sefer Yitzirah</i> promulgated a metaphysics
closely related to it.
<p>In this article I will discuss the logic of the ten Words as an expression
of a literary paradigm. This literary paradigm is visible on three different
levels of organization involving the Decalogue. I will refer to them as the
macrostructure, the central structure and the microstructure. By macrostructure
I mean the overview of the five separate versions, or editions, of the
Decalogue mentioned in the Torah. The central structure is derived from reading
the ten Words as five pairs according to the Scroll divisions. The
microstructure is found in the five parts of the first Word and the five parts
of the third Word. I will present each of the three structures separately and
then examine their common characteristics.
<h3><a name='tenwords'></a><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>The Central
Structure: Ten Words</span></h3>
<h4><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>The Problem</span></h4>
<p>This is how the Torah describes the writing on the tablets: &quot;<i>The
tablets were written across from each other; (first) on one and (then) on the
other were they written.</i>&quot; (Exodus 32.15) This description is the only
evidence we have concerning the writing on the tablets. The Hebrew phrase which
I have paraphrased &quot;across from each other&quot;, literally means
&quot;from both sides.&quot; The traditional Rabbinical commentators had great
difficulty with this phrase. They could not find a simple meaning for the
words, and so gave them a miraculous meaning. They said that this describes the
inscription on the tablets as piercing the stone from &quot;one side to the
other.&quot; This required a double miracle. The letters appeared the same on
both sides even though one side should have appeared reversed. The second
miracle involved one of the Hebrew letters with a closed shape, like an O.
Although the letter was completely cut around, it miraculously stood in midair.
I do not want to be accused of abrogating miracles, but my reading of the text
does not require one at this point. The Hebrew can be read to indicate that the
Words were written alternately on both tablets: Word one on the first, Word two
on the second, Word three returning to the first tablet, and so on. In other
contexts, the Hebrew word<i> ever</i> is normally translated &quot;across&quot;,
as in <i>ever hanahar</i>, across the river. The plural form, which we have in
the verse above, normally indicates a spatial relationship on a single plane
such as two banks of a river. This could literally describe the two separate
tablets. The Rabbinical understanding of &quot;front and back&quot; would, in
fact, be a unique usage. I believe that they were forced into this position by
either a basic misreading of the Words, or, more likely, in order to conceal
something. The latter hypothesis is supported by the difficulties created by
the Rabbinical division of the text into ten parts.
<p>Surprisingly enough, the key question concerning the ten Words is &quot;what
are they.&quot; While the Torah states in several places that there are ten
Words, nowhere does it indicate what they are. Both of the two editions
recorded in the Torah can easily be read as containing over a dozen Words! The
first problem is how to divide the text into ten parts. Since it is the
division itself that determines what underlying logic can appear in the arrangement
of the Words, I will address that issue first. There are two major traditions
regarding the division of the text into ten parts, the Rabbinical and the
Augustinian, or Catholic, divisions.
<p>The division accepted by Jewish commentators was first described in the
Mechilta, the same book that describes the miraculous writing on the tablets. I
will demonstrate a different, quite possibly more ancient, Jewish division than
that of the Mechilta. I will refer to as the <i>scroll</i> division. St.
Augustine refers to it as the <i>authentic</i> <i>Hebrew</i> division, and
since its adoption at the council of Trent it has been Church dogma.<a

That is to say, the scroll division is identical to the Augustinian. If the scroll
division predates the Mechilta, which seems likely, we have the anomaly of the
Church accepting the more ancient version while the Rabbis rejected it for a
later reading. This last fact indicates that the Rabbis may have been trying to
conceal something from the early Christians. 
<p>Here is the basis for St. Augustine's &quot;Jewish&quot; reading. The text
of the Torah, as it appears in the traditional Torah scroll, is divided into
paragraph-like sections called<i> parshiot</i>. There are very few variations
in these divisions in scrolls from different parts of the world. This testifies
to the fact that they represent an ancient tradition. The division into <i>parshiot</i>
can be read as the earliest extant commentary on the Torah. The text of the ten
Words is divided into ten <i>parshiot</i> in a manner that differs from the
division in the Mechilta.

<p>There are two basic differences between the way the Mechilta divides the
text and the way that the text appears in the Torah scroll. The variations
appear at the beginning and the end of the list while the central six
commandments from &quot;Remember the sabbath&quot; to &quot;You shall not bear
false witness&quot; are common to both divisions. In the scroll, &quot;I am the
Lord&quot; and &quot;You shall have no other&quot;, are a single unit, while
they are two commandments according to the Mechilta. The division into <i>parshiot</i>
makes up for the missing Word by separating the two injunctions against
coveting. The Mechilta develops a conceptual reading of the text based on its
division. I will present a reading according to the scroll division.
<p>At first glance, the division into <i>parshiot</i> does not provide the same
conceptual satisfaction as the Mechilta, which justifies its division by
explaining how the Words were divided between the tables. The first five Words
according to the Mechilta all include a reference to the Lord, while none of
the last five do. Therefore, the first tablet, which includes the first five
Words, refers to one's obligations towards the Lord, mentioning Him in all
five, while the second tablet, which includes the last five Words, relates
one's obligations to his fellow man. This symmetrical division between heaven
(the Lord) and earth (man) reflects the need to find a reason why the Lord
wrote the Words on two tablets. So, according to the<i> Mechilta</i>, the Lord
created two tablets and divided the Words into two sets of five in order to
demonstrate the existence of two different categories of Divine laws, those
which relate to the Lord and those which relate to man. The logic incorporated
in the tablets is thus reduced to a simple dualism. There are a number of
weaknesses in this reading: 
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'>1.<span
style='font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"times new roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
implies an actual chasm between the Divine and the human (two tablets), which
runs contrary to all of the Biblical narrative.
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'>2.<span
style='font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"times new roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
demands a miraculous understanding of Exodus 32.15.
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'>3.<span
style='font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"times new roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
offers no explanation for the significance of there being ten Words.
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'>4.<span
style='font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"times new roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
corrupts the literary unity of the first Word according to the scroll.
<p>Reading the text as five pairs of Words, according to the scroll, eliminates
these difficulties. In the following presentation I will explain why the Words
should been viewed as five successive pairs. Each pair has one component from
each tablet. The first Word appears on one tablet and the second on the other.
For the sake of clarity I will assign the numbers from 1 to 5 to the pairs of
Words, and the letters A and B to the elements within each pair. The division
between A and B reflects the way the Words might have been arranged on the
tablets: the first of each pair on tablet A and the second on tablet B.

<p>I have adopted this marking convention because it reflects the literary
structure of the ten Words when the are read as successive pairs according to
the scroll division. Each of the tablets has its own particular attribute, A
and B. Each pair of Words has its common element, 1-5. Each individual Word
combines the element of its pair (number) and the attribute of its tablet
(letter). This is the fundamental characteristic of all the tabular texts in
the Torah and of the chapters of the Mishnah: each unit (in this case Word) is
defined by the intersection of two &quot;lines&quot; of thought, the vertical
and the horizontal. While the Mechilta recognized that each of the tablets
embodies a different line of thought, it was not able to provide an adequate
description of the correlation between the parallel Words on each tablet, nor
the conceptual flow from pair one to pair five. The meaning of the text as an
integrated unit is dependent on the underlying relationships between its parts.
This is the level of meaning that I have referred to up to now as logic. It is
found by abstracting from the text:

<p>The first Word, according to the scroll, has five distinct components, which
I have marked a-e. These five parts are strikingly symmetrical. The first and
last elements, (a,e) provide a balanced framework for the central substructure,
(b-d).
<p>a. I the Lord am your God... 
<p style='margin-left:72.0pt'>b. You shall have no other...
<p style='margin-left:72.0pt'>c. You shall not... 
<p style='margin-left:72.0pt'>d. you shall not... 
<p>e. for I the Lord your God...
<p>The Lord speaks in the first person in both of the extreme elements, (a,e).
In the middle (b-d) are three injunctions. We can then speak of two substructures,
one, the framework containing the Lord's first person revelation, and the
other, the core containing the three prohibitions against idolatry. Both of the
substructures are ordered. The framework has a clear temporal element. The Lord
first refers to the past: &quot;who brought you out of the land of
Egypt&quot;(a). The fifth element relates to the future: &quot;showing kindness
to the thousandth generation&quot;(e). Both elements of the framework have in
common the Lord's actions, as opposed to the middle section that refers only to
human activity. One could also differentiate between the historical-national
perspective of the opening, as opposed to the personal justice implied in the
fifth element. We should also note hat in the last element the Lord's actions are
determined by human actions, which is not true of the redemption from Egypt. 
<p>The central structure, b-d, the realm of human actions, spans the gap
between history and eschatology. This points to a fundamental characteristic of
the text: it is ordered. There is meaning to be found in the arrangement of the
parts of the text. Before we explore the meaning to be derived from the order
of the parts, we can verify the fact that the order is significant by examining
the three part central structure. It reflects within it the structure of the
whole as an ordered triad. The whole Word divides into the triad of past(a),
present(b-d) and future(e). The central element, (b-d) of this triad expands
into a triad of persons ordered from the first to the third: 
<p>b. beside Me <br />
c. for yourself <br />
d. to them 
<p>As if the appearance of the second triad could leave the reader in doubt as
to the significance of the two tri-part divisions, the text adds a third
thread; thus the &quot;tripled knot be not loosed&quot;. The third triad
appears exactly as the previous, within the central element of a higher order
triad. Element c is composed of three spatially ordered components: 
<p>that is in heaven above, or<br />
that is in the earth beneath, or <br />
that is in the water under the earth. 
<p>I will summarize the structure of the three triads in the form of a chart.

<p>The above chart is a graphic representation of the symmetrically layered
structure of the first Word. The first line of the chart indicates that the
Word is divided into five parts, a-e. The second line shows that the five
elements of the Word group themselves into three subgroups that are based on
time and ordered from past to future. In the third line we see that the central
element of the second line divides into three ordered grammatical persons:
first, second and third. Directly under the central element of line three,
&quot;you&quot;, we see the spatial triad within c, above the earth, earth,
below the earth. 
<p>This triple symmetry of the first Word, according to the scroll, is
completely lost when the Mechilta divides it into two Words. On the other hand,
it is becoming clearer why the Rabbis of the period may have wished to suppress
the metaphysical potential contained within the first Word according to the <i>parshiot</i>.
At the time of&nbsp; the Trinitarian schism in the first and second centuries,
they may have wished to deny the schismatics any possible support from within
the tradition, even at the expense of denying deep insights to the orthodox. So
they suppressed the ancient reading according to the scroll and published the
reading that appears in the Mechilta. Conceivably, this was done to prevent the
heterodox from claiming that God revealed Himself at Sinai in a manner that
could be perceived as having Trinitarian implications. The Word is clearly
based on a tri-part division of reality into: time, person and space. These
three dimensions are mentioned in the <i>Sefer Yitzirah</i> as <i>shanah</i>,
time; <i>nefesh</i>, person; and <i>olam</i>, space. The author of the Mishnah
used a similar triad in the overall structure of the Mishnah in six Orders
which appear as three pairs according to this conceptual triad: Zerayim and
Moed -Shanah; Nashim and Nzikin- Nefesh, Kodashim and Taharot- olam. We will
see that this primary triad is a central feature of the Decalogue.
<p>The most striking literary characteristic of the first Word is its symmetry.
The overall effect of the symmetry is to focus on the center point that is
defined by the middle element of each of the three dimensions:

<p>The above illustration is a slight variation on the previous one. In it I
have emphasized the center point of the Word, which is the intersection of the
central elements of the three dimensions of the Word: present tense, second
person and the earth. The overall effect is to focus on a relationship between
an I and a you in the here and now! The first Word of the Decalogue announces,
albeit indirectly, that its focus is relationships in the here and now. Here
and now I will demonstrate an almost identical relationship in a five part
structure in the third Word.

<p>The above chart demonstrates two levels of structure within the third Word.
Both of them share some of the characteristics of the first Word. The third
Word is divided into five parts, which divide symmetrically between Divine and
human actions. The Word opens with human observance of the Sabbath (a) and
closes with the Divine parallel (e). The second element (b), human labor, is
reflected in the penultimate (d), the Divine creation. The first two elements
are from the human perspective and the last two from the Divine. Whereas the
first Word focused on human activity within the framework of the Divine, the
third Word separates the human from the Divine. As in the first word, there is
a sharp symmetry that focuses on the middle element, (c). The framework around
the central element creates a conceptual pattern that prepares the reader to
see the middle as a meeting point between the human and the Divine. Exegesis
can then attempt to describe the way in which (c) demonstrates the interface
between the Divine and the human.

</div>
<p>There are two distinct ways to explore the significance of the central
element as an interface between the human and the Divine. The difference
between them is indicative of the difference between our expectations from
linear writing, and what I am presenting as tabular writing. In the manner of
traditional homiletics, we could note that man takes responsibility for other
creatures in (c). These creatures are referred to in element (d), &quot;the
Lord made heaven and earth and sea, and all that is in them&quot;. From this
point of view, the connection between the human and the Divine involves human
responsibility for the Divine creation. While this conclusion is certainly
true, it does not take into account the full depth of the text. In order to do
so, it is necessary to relate to the ordered elements of (c). The central
element, III, refers to a master/servant relationship. This is the focal point
of the Word. The separate realms of the Divine (V, IV) and the human (I, II)
meet at the element focused on the master/servant relationship. It is
noteworthy that the five part third Word, as well as its five part third
element are both organized from the immanent to the transcendent. Within the
larger framework, the &quot;other&quot; is the Lord. Within element c the &quot;other&quot;
is represented by the &quot;stranger&quot;. The very center of the Word, the
master/servant relationship, is a reflection of the relationship between the
Lord and his servants, Israel. To summarize: we have seen that the symmetry of
the third Word creates a conceptual picture; in elements a and b man; in
elements d and e the Lord; in the central element, c, a set of relationships of
dependency and authority that reflect the relationship between man and the
Lord. 
<p>We have examined two similar micro-structures, the first and third Words
according to the scroll. They have two similar characteristics. First, both are
highly symmetrical. Second, the structure of both words utilizes the bold
symmetries to create a focus around the central element as a focal point at the
exact center of the Word. In both cases the focal point is ordered within
itself. In the first Word the central element is ordered spatially: above,
earth, below. We found that the central element of the third Word is ordered
relationally, from the close to the distant. The effect of the focal symmetry
is to draw the reader into the center of the Word. Once he focuses on the
center point, he becomes aware of sets of relationships which underlie the
text. This seems to imply a different paradigm for reading than we are
accustomed to. The text has to be grasped as an image rather than simply a
linear presentation. The reader is required to &quot;see&quot; the text as a
whole that, as it were, spreads out from a central point. If this is an
overstatement, at the very least, the reader must be attuned to the unique
rhetoric of the text, a rhetoric based on order and symmetry. It is hard to
believe that the author of the Mechilta was not aware of these characteristics
of the Biblical text, and unwittingly deprived the following generations of
their patrimony, the revelation at Sinai as transmitted in the Torah scroll
reflecting the tabular paradigm of the tablets.
<h4><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>Reading the Ten Words According to
the Scroll Divisions</span></h4>
<p>I will now present the literary arguments for reading the ten Words as five
pairs, based primarily on the connection between the form and the content of
the text. I will demonstrate that the five pairs utilize the same symmetry we
found in the micro-structures of the first and third Words. Seen as a whole,
the five pairs repeat the pattern enunciated in the first Word, thereby raising
the pattern to the level of paradigm. We will see later that the five-part
paradigm is used also in other strata of the text. The analysis of the ten
Words is divided into three parts. First I will offer the <i>prima fascia</i>
evidence that the Words are in fact five pairs. After identifying the pairs, I
will describe the conceptual flow from pair to pair. Finally I will show that
there is a consistent distinction between the first and second element of each
pair that creates the distinction between the two tablets.

<p><q class='psuq'><i>Five Pairs<o:p></o:p></i></q>
<p>The last two Words according to the division in the Torah scroll are clearly
a pair, beginning with the same words: &quot;You shall not covet&quot;. Also at
the beginning of the list, in the other place where the scroll differs from the
Mechilta, we can see a clear pair of Words. Both &quot;I the Lord&quot; and
&quot;You shall not swear falsely by the name of the Lord your God&quot; refer
directly to the Lord. The third and fourth Words according to the scroll are a
structural pair. They are similar in several ways:
<p style='margin-left:18.0pt;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"times new roman";color:windowtext'><v:shape id="_x0000_i1038"

</v:shape><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>They
differ from all the other Words in that they are imperatives,
&quot;Remember&quot; and &quot;Honor&quot;, while the other eight Words are
injunctions.
<p style='margin-left:18.0pt;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'><span style='font-size:

<p style='margin-left:18.0pt;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:"times new roman";color:windowtext'><v:shape id="_x0000_i1042"

</v:shape><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>They
both state reasons for observing the Words and refer to the Lord in these
reasons: &quot;for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth&quot;, &quot;that
you may long endure on the land which the Lord your God is giving you&quot;.
The two &quot;reasons&quot; have an interesting relationship to each other. The
first is historical referring to the creation of the world. The second reason
is also within the framework of time, but opposite in direction from the first,
pointing to the future rather than the past: enjoying a long life in the
future. 
<p>There are enough similarities between the third and fourth Words to warrant
considering them a pair. Yet, as if the similarities may leave the reader with
even the slightest doubt as to whether s/he should see these two Words as a
pair, Moses drives the point home with the retelling of the ten Words in the
book of Deuteronomy. There he adds the identical addition to both Words:
&quot;as the Lord your God commanded you&quot;. This common addition to the
third and fourth Words removes any doubt that we are to read these two as a
pair. Having now identified the first four and last two Words as three pairs,
we are left with four simple injunctions: 
<p>3A. You shall not murder.<br />
3B. You shall not commit adultery.<br />
4A. You shall not steal.<br />
4B. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor 
<p>All four Words refer to social offenses. The first two (3A and 3B) have a
bodily component lacking in the next two. Murder and adultery have bodies as
their objects while stealing and false witness do not. Although this
distinction may not seem to be of great significance at first, it allows us to
view the Words as five pairs. Each pair can be spread across both tablets with
the first element of the pair appearing on the first tablet and the second
element on the second tablet. In other words, one tablet contains the odd
numbered Words and the other tablet contains the even numbered Words, thus
fulfilling the literal meaning of Exodus 32.15. 
<h3><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>The flow From Pair to Pair</span></h3>
<p>We now have two tests for coherence within this division of the Words:
first, the flow from pair to pair; second, the distinction between elements of
each pair. The two together provide the key to understanding the logic implied
by having the ten Words divided on two tablets. The five pairs are ordered from
the Divine to the mundane. The first pair begins with the ultimate Divine
revelation. The fifth pair is restricted to human envy. At the beginning is the
absolute other who identifies himself by his name, <i>anochi</i> &quot;I
myself&quot;, at the end the individual self. Neither of the extremes mentions
interpersonal actions. The first pair relates to the Lord as the sole object of
worship and guarantor of the social order, while the last pair does not go
beyond personal emotion. The fourth pair is inextricably connected to the fifth
pair. It provides the domain in which envy can be expressed: &quot;you shall
not steal.&quot; Similarly, the second pair is closely linked to the first
pair. It refers to time and the Lord's continuing involvement in creation, the
domain in which He expresses His will. In the middle, between the upper realm
of Divine creation, and the lower realm of private property and desires, stands
the interface between two realms: naked corporeal man. Obviously, this is just
a general outline of the figure generated by reading the Words as five pairs.
Nevertheless, it provides a very clear framework within which to explore the
relationships between the Words. 
<p>I am about to argue that meaning can be derived from the arrangement of the
Words on the stone tablets. Certainly, from one point of view this can be seen
as fantastic, since no one but Moses ever saw the tablets. Nevertheless, the
reiteration of the two tablet figure in the Torah, as well as in the three
millennia since it appeared, demand a serious analysis. The outline of my
argument is as follows: Literary analysis of the ten Words as they are divided
in the Torah scroll leads to the visualization of the Words as I laid them out
above in five pairs. Once they are arranged in this format, additional meaning
becomes available which is not otherwise apparent. My argument rests on the
strength and value of the additional meaning. According to the Biblical
narrative, the ten Words are the only text ever written by the Lord. As such, I
look for an extreme cogency in the text, worthy of its reported origin. Thus I
would expect the added meaning to amplify the significance of the tablets as a
pact or testimony, as they are described throughout the Torah. If this added
meaning significantly increases our understanding of the nature of the ten
Words as a whole, and specifically the character of the tablets as evidencing a
pact between God and man, then I will feel confident that the arrangement that
I have provided was most likely the arrangement on the tablets.
<p>The most interesting aspect of the figure inscribed on the tablets,
according to this arrangement, is its similarity to the event at which the
Words were stated, the revelation at Mount Sinai. It is as if the tablets were
meant to create a universalized picture or impression of the event. The order
of the pairs reflects the picture of God above, and the individual below, with
a confrontation between self and another in the middle. At both extremes are
subjects, at the top the Lord identified by His personal name, <i>anochi</i>, I
My Self, the absolute Other, at the bottom the individual personal self. The
repetition of &quot;You shall not covet&quot; emphasizes that the individual is
seen in the last pair as desiring to receive something that properly belongs to
another. On the other end, in the first pair, the Lord wishes to give that
which is properly His, His commandments and His name. The five pairs can be
read from either perspective: as they are presented in the Torah according to
the Divine perspective, or from the bottom up, according to the human
perspective. This is especially revealing in terms of the handing down of the
tablets. The perspective of the Lord is from above, handing down. He must descend
to the mountain. The perspective of the receiver is from below, from the
perspective of the individual. He must climb the mountain. The tablets then,
are impressed with a conceptual representation of the meeting of man and God,
man rising from below and God coming down from above, the event reported at Mt.
Sinai!
<p>This reading of the tablets implies a relationship that is not an historical
event, but rather a description of reality. There are three tiers or ranges of
experience between the self and God, each with its own proper element. The
closest to the human perspective is the range of things which can be coveted,
pair four, the realm of possessions. If they are chattels, they can be stolen.
If they are abstract, such as reputation, they can be abrogated through false
testimony. This is the day to day world of change, commerce, fame. Its
characteristic is attribution- mine, yours; true, false. The level of the
second pair of Words, adjacent to the Divine perspective, is the realm of
interdependencies, or causality. Its element is time. The middle level is
personhood. Its element is life and sex. In the most ancient of kabbalistic
books, <i>Sefer Yitzirah</i>, these are the three prime &quot;dimensions&quot;:
<i>shanah</i>- time, <i>nefesh</i>- life force, and <i>olam</i>- the physical
world. This triad appears in the same order as it appears in <i>Sefer Yitzirah</i>
in pairs 2-4 and in the structure of the first Word. 
<p>Let us summarize the overview of the five pairs of Words. The first and last
pairs both deal with consciousness. The subject of the first is the universal
consciousness, the Lord who speaks in the first person. At the other extreme,
the creature, steeped in his own thoughts. Between them is a three dimensional
field of action. The dimensions are: time, life and objective attribution.

of God
<p class='msofootnotetext'>Called also simply thE COMMANDMENTS, thE TEN
COMMANDMENTS, or thE DECALOGUEUE (Gr. <i>deka</i>, ten, and <i>logos</i>, a
word), the Ten Words of Sayings, the latter name generally applied by the Greek
Fathers.
<p class='msofootnotetext'>The Ten Commandments are precepts bearing on the
fundamental obligations of religion and morality and embodying the revealed
expression of the Creator's will in relation to man's whole duty to God and to
his fellow-creatures. They are found twice recorded in the Pentateuch, in
Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5, but are given in an abridged form in the
catechisms. Written by the finger of God on two tables of stone, this Divine
code was received from the Almighty by Moses amid the thunders of Mount Sinai,
and by him made the ground-work of the Mosaic Law. Christ resumed these
Commandments in the double precept of charity--love of God and of the
neighbour; He proclaimed them as binding under the New Law in Matthew 19 and in
the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5). He also simplified or interpreted them,
e.g. by declaring unnecessary oaths equally unlawful with false, by condemning
hatred and calumny as well as murder, by enjoining even love of enemies, and by
condemning indulgence of evil desires as fraught with the same malice as adultery
(Matthew 5). The Church, on the other hand, after changing the day of rest from
the Jewish Sabbath, or seventh day of the week, to the first, made the Third
Commandment refer to Sunday as the day to be kept holy as the Lord's Day. The
Council of Trent (Sess. VI, can. xix) condemns those who deny that the Ten
Commandments are binding on Christians.
<p class='msofootnotetext'>There is no numerical division of the Commandments in
the Books of Moses, but the injunctions are distinctly tenfold, and are found
almost identical in both sources. The order, too, is the same except for the
final prohibitions pronounced against concupiscence, that of Deuteronomy being
adopted in preference to Exodus. A confusion, however, exists in the numbering,
which is due to a difference of opinion concerning the initial precept on
Divine worship. The system of numeration found in Catholic Bibles is based on
the Hebrew text, was made by St. Augustine (fifth century) in his book of
&quot;Questions of Exodus&quot; (&quot;Qu<span lang='he' dir='rtl'
style='font-family:arial;mso-ascii-font-family:"trebuchet ms";mso-hansi-font-family:
"trebuchet ms"'>ז</span>stionum in Heptateuchum libri VII&quot;, Bk. II, Question
lxxi), and was adopted by the Council of Trent. It is followed also by the
German Lutherans, except those of the school of Bucer. This arrangement makes
the First Commandment relate to false worship and to the worship of false gods
as to a single subject and a single class of sins to be guarded against--the
reference to idols being regarded as mere application of the precept to adore
but one God and the prohibition as directed against the particular offense of
idolatry alone. According to this manner of reckoning, the injunction
forbidding the use of the Lord's Name in vain comes second in order; and the
decimal number is safeguarded by making a division of the final precept on
concupiscence--the Ninth pointing to sins of the flesh and the Tenth to desires
for unlawful possession of goods. Another division has been adopted by the
English and Helvetian Protestant Churches on the authority of Philo Jud<span
lang=he dir='rtl' style='font-family:arial;mso-ascii-font-family:"trebuchet ms";
mso-hansi-font-family:"trebuchet ms"'>ז</span>us, Josephus Origen, and others<span
dir=rtl></span><span lang='he' dir='rtl' style='font-family:arial;mso-ascii-font-family:
"trebuchet ms";mso-hansi-font-family:"trebuchet ms"'><span dir='rtl'></span>, </span>whereby
two Commandments are made to cover the matter of worship, and thus the
numbering of the rest is advanced one higher; and the Tenth embraces both the
Ninth and Tenth of the Catholic division. It seems, however, as logical to
separate at the end as to group at the beginning, for while one single object
is aimed at under worship, two specifically different sins are forbidden under
covetousness; if adultery and theft belong to two distinct species of moral
wrong, the same must be said of the desire to commit these evils.
