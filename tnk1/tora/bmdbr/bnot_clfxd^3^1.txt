<< I would say that God's response showed that the social arrangements were
 not how God would order the world. However, He honored man's structure to
 govern itself within His commandments.  For the same reason, Rambam
 explained that sacrifices were permitted within the law, which allowed the
 people to bridge their previous practices into their new
 relationship with God. He allowed man's current social order, within the
 new comandments given, to continue to exist until man deemed it time to
 evolve into a higher social order. >>

  This explanation works well if one accepts the Rambam's understanding of 
sacrifices. It would be out of bounds according to the Ramban who criticizes 
the Rambam for not realizing the the chesed that God gave man in offering 
sacrifices as a means of concretizing and expiating the process of teshuva.
