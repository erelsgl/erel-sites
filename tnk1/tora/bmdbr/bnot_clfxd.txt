 Were the Daughters of Tzelofchad Early Jewish Feminists
                            
                  By Rav Elchanan Samet


A.

     The  feminist  movement  in the  Western  world  has
undergone many changes during the 20th century, and  even
today   there  are  several  different  feminine  voices.
Nonetheless, it would appear that there is a common  idea
that  unites all the different voices within the movement
-  the demand for non-discrimination against women in our
society,  neither  in  law  nor  in  the  actual   social
circumstances.

     Is  it  legitimate to view the struggle of the  five
daughters  of  Tzelofchad to inherit their father  as  an
example  of  an  ancient feminine struggle for  equality?
Can the feminist movement, in its search for roots within
the  Biblical world, adopt the characters of  these  five
women  and view them as harbingers of the feminine demand
for equality and non-discrimination?

     At  first glance, the answer appears to be positive.
In  a world where the laws of inheritance allow only  men
to  inherit,  these five women appear  and  demand  equal
rights with men.  Can there be a greater example for  the
demand  for women's equality?  Moshe stands before  their
revolutionary demand without an answer and  brings  their
case before God.  God, before whom all are equal, men and
women  alike, answers. "The daughters of Tzelofchad speak
right;  you  shall give them a possession of  inheritance
among their father's brothers..." (pasuk 7).

     On   the  other  hand,  conservative  opponents   of
feminism  could argue, correctly, that the  daughters  of
Tzelofchad  raise their demand only because their  father
does  not  have  male children.  As they say  explicitly,
"Our  father...and had no sons...for he had no son...give
us a portion" (pesukim 3-4).

     In  God's  answer as well, he does  not  equate  the
rights  of  women to inherit with that of  men  but  only
gives  them  a portion in a case like that of  Tzelofchad
where there are no sons.  God's answer to Moshe is: "If a
man   shall  die  without  a  son,  you  shall  pass  his
inheritance to his daughter" (pasuk 8).  So what sort  of
equality is this?

B.

     We  have  to  first  examine  the  argument  of  the
daughters of Tzelofchad.  At the outset, in pasuk 3, they
explain  the  background from which their demand  arises.
"Our  father  died in the desert and he was  not  in  the
congregation   which   gathered  against   God   in   the
congregation of Korach, for he died in his  sin,  and  he
had no sons."

     The important part of this background information is
the statement that "our father died in his sin and he had
no  sons."  Why do the daughters mention the sin of their
father that was the cause of his death?

     The Talmud in Bava Batra 117b derives from this that
"the  complainers in the congregation of Korach  did  not
receive a portion in the land."

     The   question  then  is:  What  was  the   sin   of
Tzelofchad?  If he did not die in one of the plagues that
resulted  from various sins of the people, he undoubtedly
died  in the general decree that followed the sin of  the
spies, as all of those who left Egypt died.

     The  Gemara  (Shabbat  96b)  quotes  a  disagreement
between Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira.

     What  was  the sin of Tzelofchad? Rabbi  Akiva  said
     Tzelofchad  was  the woodcutter.  Rabbi  Yehuda  ben
     Beteira  said that he was from the ma'apilim  (those
     who  attempted to go to Israel after the Sin of  the
     Spies without permission).

     Why  did  they attempt to define a specific sin  for
Tzelofchad and not merely allow him to die as  all  those
of  that generation died, as a result of the sin  of  the
spies?   This  is  derived  from  the  language  of   the
daughters, "for he died in HIS sin."  The implication  is
that  he  died as a result of a sin specific to  himself.
The  Ramban, who declines to enumerate a specific sin for
Tzelofchad, explains that the sentence "for he died" is a
shortened version.  The full version would read:  "for he
died  in  his  sin in that he did not enter the  land  of
Israel."

     No  specific sin is being mentioned here but  rather
an  explanation,  that  just  like  all  members  of  his
generation, he, too, did not merit in his sins  to  enter
the  land of Israel. This leads to the explanation of Rav
Yehuda  Halevi, as quoted by his friend and contemporary,
the Ibn Ezra.

     "For  he died in his sin" - Rav Yehuda HaLevi  said:
     "He died in his sin is directly connected to "and he
     had  no sons."  Just as one would say today "because
     of his sins some calamity happened to so and so."

This explanation has a number of advantages:

     1)  It  is not respectful for his daughters  to  say
that Tzelofchad died for some specific sin if there is no
need  to  enumerate what that was.  It  would  have  been
sufficient for them to simply indicate he did not  belong
to the congregation of Korach.  According to Rabbi Yehuda
HaLevi,  the  verse  does  not  refer  to  any   sin   of
Tzelofchad.   It is merely the common expression  whereby
any calamity is explained because of the sins of man.

     2)  One doesn't need to add words to the sentence as
the Ramban does.

    3)  The  trope of the verse, where a stop  (etnachta)
is  found  after the words "The congregation of  Korach,"
would appear to support this explanation.

    The  explanation  of Rabbi Yehuda HaLevi  returns  us
once  again  to  the question whether  the  daughters  of
Tzelofchad should be considered feminists.  What sort  of
feminists  would say about their father that  because  of
his sins he had no sons but only daughters?!

C.

    After   the  daughters  of  Tzelofchad  explain   the
background to their request, they come to the main point.
"Why should the name of our father be eliminated from his
family  because  he had no son. Give us a portion  within
the brothers of our father" (pasuk 4).

    The  practical  part  of  their  demand:  Give  us  a
portion - is understood.  But what is the meaning of  the
preceding  explanation of their demand, with a rhetorical
question,   "Why  should  the  name  of  our  father   be
eliminated from within his family?"  Unfortunately, these
words are not explained by the ancient commentators.
    
    The  name of a man is a central concept in the  world
of  Tanakh.   There  are  a  number  of  closely  related
explanations for this word but the most important one for
our  purposes is:  that which continues a man's existence
within the human context after his death.  Man's physical
existence ceases with his death but his "shem," his name,
his  metaphorical essence, continues to exist within  our
world in a certain sense.  A man has an existential  need
to  anchor  his  existence within eternity.   A  man  who
leaves  the world without any continuity, without  having
left  a mark on anything that stays after him, suffers  a
grievous loss.  His name and memory disappear and  he  is
cut  off  all eternity.  The value of his short  life  is
negated and he is like the dust blowing in the wind.

    From  earliest  times, this necessity  has  concerned
man.   Ancient burial customs are connected to this need.
Many  other things that men do in their lives are  of  no
other  purpose  than  to perpetuate his  name  after  his
death.   One  might  claim that  the  majority  of  human
creations, both material and spiritual, derive  from  the
need  to  deal with the feeling of temporality  in  man's
life  and to ensure the continuation of his "name"  after
he  passes  away.  Many cultures have suggested solutions
and  the parasha of the Tower of Bavel does in fact  deal
with one of those solutions.

    How  does the Israelite man in Tanakh perpetuate  his
name?  There are two ways that are necessarily combined -
by  having  children and by passing over to his  children
his  ancestral  portion in land.  Having  children  as  a
means of continuity is understood to contemporary man  as
well.   But  having one's family inhabit one's  ancestral
prequires some explanation.

    The  land  that  a Jew inherits in the biblical  era,
that  he  inherits from his fathers and forefathers,  was
not understood by him merely as a material possession nor
as  a means of production.  Having one's children live in
the  same  portion while continuing to work the land  was
understood as a means of continuing the living connection
of  fathers  to  children from generation to  generation.
The familial ancestral portion serves as the glue between
the  generations  which pass over the  land,  as  Kohelet
said, "A generation comes and a generation goes, but  the
land always remains."

    We  must  remember that the land was nachalat Hashem,
the portion of God that was given to the forefathers in a
covenant, and was conquered and divided at the time  when
God  fulfilled  His covenant with this  very  generation.
Israel  as a people is also called "God's portion."   The
Torah   intends  to  create  a  permanent   and   eternal
connection  between  the man, Israel,  and  the  land  of
Israel.

    When  a man settles his ancestral portion, builds  on
it  his family, and leaves it to his children after  him,
he  succeeds  in  establishing "his name  forever."   The
individual  passes away but leaves a permanent  mark  for
himself  and  his  forefathers through his  children  and
children's children, who will also inherit the same land.
There  is no greater evil in the life of such a man  than
if,  when  he passes away, he has no continuity  and  his
name is lost.  This evil can occur to a man in one of two
ways  -  either by his being separated from his ancestral
portion  in  one way of another, or by his death  without
children.

    Two  mitzvot are intended to prevent this evil.   The
mitzva  of yovel and the laws dealing with the redemption
of  land sold for economic reasons are designed to ensure
that  the  land should return to the family  of  the  man
whose portion it was. The mitzva of yibum is designed  to
provide  children  for one who has no children,  so  that
"his name not be erased from Israel."

    There  is  indeed  a  connection  between  these  two
mitzvot.   The halakha states that a brother who performs
yibum  with  the  wife  of  his  deceased  brother,  also
inherits  the portion in the land.  This connection  lies
at  the  root of the story of Ruth and Boaz.   When  Boaz
comes  to  redeem the field of Elimelekh and his children
who  are his relatives, he states, (Ruth 4: 9-10):   "You
are my witnesses that I have acquired all that belongs to
Machlon  and Chilyon from the hands of Naomi.  And  also,
Ruth,  the Moabite, the wife of Machlon, I have  acquired
as  a wife in order to establish the name of the deceased
on  his portion, so that the name of the deceased not  be
cut off from within his brothers and from the gate of his
locale.  You are my witness today."

    These  words of Boaz are the equivalent of the  words
of  the daughters of Tzelofchad.  Why should the name  of
Tzelofchad be eliminated ("gara") from within his family?
The basic meaning of the root G.R.A. in Tanakh means "cut
off,"  detached.  Therefore, the daughters of  Tzelofchad
can  say, "Why should the name of our father be  cut  off
from  within  his brothers?"  Why is the  name  cut  off?
Because his portion in the land is not being given to his
descendants   but  to  other  relatives   who   are   not
descendants.

    Tragic  circumstances, whereby a man's  name  is  cut
off, could indeed happen in the ancient world.  If a  man
died  without children and for one reason or another  his
wife  did  not perform yibum, then, indeed,  his  portion
would  be  passed  on  to distant  relatives  and  direct
continuation  of his line would be ended.   Is  this  the
case  of  Tzelofchad, who, in fact, has  five  daughters?
That  is  exactly the argument of Tzelofchad's daughters.
Our  father DID leave descendants - five daughters -  and
those  daughters are capable of continuing  the  familial
continuity  generation after generation by  marrying  and
having  children and grandchildren, all of whom  will  be
direct  descendants  of Tzelofchad.   They  will  not  be
without  a  portion.  The husbands of  the  daughters  of
Tzelofchad will be the owners of the land and  they  will
pass it on to their children.

    But  this  will not continue "the name" of Tzelofchad
because  his portion in the land of God will not pass  on
to  those  direct descendants but will be given to  other
relatives,  since the laws of inheritance recognize  only
male  inheritors.  Therefore, they ask:  why  should  the
name of our father be eliminated, be cut off, from within
his  family?   Does not Torah strive to  find  a  way  to
maintain  the name of a man after his death,  and  should
not  that  necessity take precedence  over  the  laws  of
inheritance?

    The  sages present this argument in a dramatic  legal
dialogue (Bava Batra 119b).
    
    Benot  Tzelofchad were wise.  They spoke to the hour.
    That  is  what  Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak  said:   This
    teaches  us  that Moshe was teaching the  parasha  of
    yibum,  as it is written, Devarim 25:7, "the brothers
    sit   together."  They  said  to  him:  if   we   are
    considered  as  a  son (for the purposes  of  yibum),
    give  us  the portion of the son.  And if  not,  then
    our   mothers  should  perform  yibum.   Immediately,
    "Moshe brought their case before God."

D.

    Now  we  can return to the question that we presented
at  the  beginning  of  the shiur.   Should  we  see  the
struggle  of the five daughters of Tzelofchad to  inherit
their  father  as  an  example  of  an  ancient  feminine
struggle?   Now that we have uncovered their  motivation,
as  expressed by the question "Why should the name of our
father  be eliminated?" - it is clear that the answer  is
negative.   They were not motivated by their own  rights,
and  their  own welfare, nor was equality of  inheritance
rights  for women what lay at the root of their  demands,
but  something else entirely - the concern for the  name,
the  memory, the continuity of their father,  which  will
continue to exist through his daughters and grandchildren
who  will  live on the land which he received  from  God.
These  five  women  are  not  trying  to  bring  about  a
revolution, not even a small one.  Their arguments  arise
deeply  from  within the conceptual world of  the  Tanakh
concerning  the establishment of a man's  name  over  his
land,  and  they  are arguing for the extension  of  this
biblical  principle and its precedence over  the  general
laws of inheritance.  In fact, their whole argument - the
basic right of a man to have his name continue after  his
death   -  is  deeply  rooted  in  a  patriarchal  social
structure.   Normally, a woman leaves her father's  house
and  his  estate and joins her husband's  house  and  his
estate.  Her children will be called by the name of their
father and will inherit his portion and thereby establish
his name for one generations.  What about the woman?   In
several instances, the halakha states:  "A man's wife  is
like  his person" (ishto ke-gufo).  This is what  applies
here.   Her  joining her husband's family  makes  her  an
integral   part  of  that  family.   Her  continuity   is
established  by  the  settling of  her  children  on  her
husband's land.

    The  daughters  of Tzelofchad do not  challenge  this
social  structure. On the contrary, they  agree  with  it
totally.   The Talmud in Bava Batra 119b makes  it  clear
that had there been a son, they would not have argued for
their  own inheritance, because the need of their  father
for  the  continuity  of his name would  have  been  full
satisfied.

    Only in the extraordinary case of Tzelofchad who  had
no  sons  would  his daughters fulfill a  dual  role,  by
joining  their  husbands' families  while  maintaining  a
concurrent independent status, since they also  serve  as
inheritors for their father.  Their children will inherit
a  double  portion,  continuing the name  both  of  their
maternal grandfather and of their paternal grandfather.

E.

    
    In  several  of  the stories of Tanakh which  revolve
around the need to establish a "name," we find that women
are  at  the front of the battle.  We can mention several
examples.    Tamar   struggled  to  fulfill   the   yibum
obligation  in the family of Yehuda.  Ruth brought  about
the  redemption of the lands of Machlon, which will serve
to  maintain  Machlon's name.  The woman  of  Tekoah  who
comes  to complain before David is also an example,  even
though the story she presents is, in fact, fictional.  "I
am  a widow and my husband has died.  Andhis servant  has
two  sons  and they have fought in the field and  no  one
could  save  them and one struck the other and  he  died.
One  struck the other and killed him.  And all the family
rose  on  me and said: give us he who struck his  brother
that  we  may  kill him, in return for the  soul  of  his
brother   whom  he  killed.  And  we  will  destroy   his
inheritor.  And they will extinguish my ember  which  has
been  left  to  me  so that no name will  remain  for  my
husband  nor a remnant on the face of the earth"  (Samuel
II 13:5-7).

    The  daughters  of Tzelofchad join this distinguished
gallery,  struggling for the rights of the  dead  man  in
their  family  to have his name be established  over  his
portion.  What is special in this story as opposed to all
the  previous  ones  I mentioned, is  that  here  we  are
dealing with single daughters fighting for their fathers'
name.  However, there is no real difference between  them
and  Tamar and Ruth and the other women who struggled  to
establish the name of men in their families.

F.

     Indeed,   reading  the  story  within  the  biblical
context,  eliminates any feminine hint.  On the contrary,
it shows the daughters of Tzelofchad completely accepting
the  laws of the patriarchal society in which they  live.
They  are not fighting for their rights as women but  for
the rights of their father.  Nonetheless, at the root  of
their argument, and in its acceptance by God, there  does
lie  a basic principle connected to the inherent equality
of  the sexes.  The daughters of Tzelofchad point out  an
injustice,  that  because  of  the  laws  of  inheritance
whereby  only males inherit, their father's name will  be
eliminated from within his family.  They argue  that  the
principle   of  preserving  a  man's  name  should   take
precedence over the laws of inheritance. We can ask  why?
We have already pointed out that tragic circumstances can
arise  whereby a man's name will be cut off, if  he  dies
without  any children and his wife cannot perform  yibum.
Here  too,  the  law  should  be  paramount,  since   the
daughters  cannot inherit, and as far as the  possibility
of  establishing this dead man's name over his portion it
is  as though they do not exist.  Tzelofchad will be  one
of  those  tragic cases.  Why do they maintain,  and  why
does  God  agree with them, that the laws of  inheritance
should be changed in this case.  The answer is that on  a
basic  human level, a man who has children, whether  male
or  female,  understands his circumstances  (assuming  he
possesses  common sense) as one who has in fact  achieved
continuity.  This continuity is a fact stronger than  any
social  order  that gives precedence to one  sex  or  the
other.   The contradiction between this basic human  fact
and the laws of inheritance creates a situation difficult
to  accept.   A man raises a family, has children,  feels
that he has continued his existence and his name for  the
next  generation, but will lose that because of a  social
arrangement  which gives inheritance only  to  his  sons.
Those  social  arrangements, therefore, retreat  in  this
case,  by  God's  command, before the  basic  existential
feeling of a man that, in terms of his continuity in this
world, there is no significance to the difference between
sons and daughters.
     
     On  the human existential level, therefore, there is
an  equality of value between men and women.  Not  always
is  this  equality evident, because social  arrangements,
and  the  force  of daily life which is  based  on  those
social  arrangements, obscure it.  The statement  of  the
daughters   of  Tzelofchad  sharpened  the  contradiction
between  the arrangements of the patriarchal society  and
that which is prior to any social arrangement - the basic
human  equality of man as created by God.  In this  case,
the  precedence of that equality over social  arrangement
becomes clear.

     In  conclusion, we should examine the  statement  of
the  Sifri  on our parasha as explained by the Netziv  in
his  commentary  to the Sifri.  First the  words  of  the
Sifri:

     "The  daughters  of Tzelofchad came forward."   When
     the  daughters of Tzelofchad heard that the land was
     being  divided  among the males and  not  among  the
     females, they all got together to confer. They said:
     The  mercy of man is not like the mercy of God.  The
     mercy  of man feels more for males than for females.
     But  He  who has created the world is not that  way.
     His  mercy is for both males and females. His  mercy
     is  for all as is written: (Tehillim 145:9) "God  is
     good to all and His mercy is for all His creations."

     The Netziv comments:
     
     It  would appear that their logic was faulty because
     they  also  knew that women do not inherit  wherever
     there  is a male descendant. This does not represent
     a lack of mercy because the daughters will marry men
     and  share  in  their  inheritance.   But  the  real
     explanation  is as follows: There is a great  sorrow
     for  a man to see his inheritance given to strangers
     and  his  name  be eliminated from the  inheritance.
     When   there  is  a  son,  the  daughters  are   not
     distressed that they get it all; quite the contrary,
     the  son represents the main portion of the father's
     house.  But if there is no son and strangers eat the
     portion, it is a very great sorrow and this  is  the
     mercy  (to which they referred). This is the meaning
     of  their  statement, "Why should the  name  of  our
     father be eliminated?" They mention his name and his
     memory, for the sorrow involved that his name should
     not be continued over his estate.
