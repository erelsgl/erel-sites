I would suggest that the answer to both questions is implicit in the 
question. The development of Torah by question and answer, investigation 
and deduction, is essential to Torah. While Torah she-bichtav is God's 
direct word, it too shares with Torah she-baal peh the nature of a 
dialogue, and these two stories illustrate that.
