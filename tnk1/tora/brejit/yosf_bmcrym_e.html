<p>I bring here&nbsp; a summary of an
interesting discussion from the VBM Parsha discussion list. (you can

<h2> Question</h2>
<p> Seven hundred years ago, Ramban
(Bereishit 42:9) posed a difficult question, one which continues to puzzle
whoever studies the book of Bereishit:
<blockquote>
<p> How is it that Yosef, after
living many years in Egypt, having attained a high and influential
position in the house of an important Egyptian official, did not send
his father even one message to inform him (that he was alive) and
comfort him? Egypt is only six days' travel from Chevron, and respect
for his father would have justified even a year's journey! ... [It
would] have been a grave sin to torment his father by leaving him in
mourning and bereavement for himself and for Shimon; even if he wanted
to hurt his brothers a little, how could he not feel pity for his aged father?
<p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p dir='ltr'>Abarbanel (chap. 41, question 4) poses the same question, but
more bluntly: Why did Yosef hide his identity from his brothers and speak
harshly to them? It is criminal to be as vengeful and recriminating as a
serpent! ... How is it that as his brothers were starving and far from
home, having left their families and small children and, above all, his
aged, worried and suffering father waiting for them, did he not show
compassion, but rather intensified the anguish by arresting Shimon?

<h3 id='answer1'>Yosef wanted to fulfil his
dreams&nbsp;/ The Ramban</h3>
<p> Ramban's own astonishing answer to his question is
that Yosef's goal was to guarantee the fulfillment of his
dreams. Even after the first dream had been realized, he
intensified the deception in order to fulfill the second
dream.
<blockquote>
He did everything in its proper time in order to
fulfill the dreams, for he knew they would be
fulfilled perfectly.
</blockquote>
<p> Rabbi Yitzchak Arama (Akedat Yitzchak, 29, ques. 9;
see also Abarbanel, chap. 41, ques. 6) finds Ramban's
solution puzzling.
<blockquote>
What did he stand to gain by having his dreams
fulfilled? Even had there been some advantage, that
would not have justified sinning toward his father!
And as for the dreams, let the Giver of dreams
provide their solutions. It seems very foolish to
strive to fulfill dreams, as the fulfillment does
not depend on the dreamer's will.
</blockquote>
<p> Professor Nechama Leibowitz, in her commentary to
Bereishit (p. 327), believes that dreams can indeed be
acted upon. She cites as proof Gideon, who hears a
Midianite tell a dream, and acts upon it (Judges
7:13,14), as well as the Babylonian exiles (Ezra 1), who
did not wait for the seventy years of Jeremiah's prophecy
to pass, but returned on their own, beforehand.
<p> In my opinion, Prof. Leibowitz is mistaken. There
are two differences between her examples and the case at
hand, both of which are mentioned as well by R. Yitzchak
Arama.
<p> First, neither Gideon nor the Babylonian exiles
committed a grave offense in following their dreams.
Their dreams did not contradict honoring parents, and
certainly did not call on them to cause others grief.
Secondly, Scripture itself clearly differentiates dreams
from prophecy:
<blockquote>
Let the prophet who has a dream tell his dream;
And [let the prophet] who bears My word speak My
word truthfully;
What is straw to wheat? The Lord has spoken.
(Yirmiyahu 23:38)
</blockquote>
<p>As the Talmud (Berakhot 55a) explains:
<blockquote>
Rabbi Yochanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon bar
Yochai: Just as wheat cannot exist without chaff,
there cannot be a dream without false elements.
Rabbi Berekhia said: Although a dream may be
partially fulfilled, it will not be fulfilled in its
entirety. How do we know this? From Yosef, as it is
written: "The sun (representing Yosef's father), the
moon (his mother), and eleven stars [are bowing down
to me]," and at the time, his mother was no longer
alive.
</blockquote>
<p> The prophet Yirmiyahu teaches us that dreams are the
outer shell of prophecy, just as chaff is the outer shell
of wheat. The true prophet is able to separate grain from
chaff in order to eventually produce clean flour for
baking. It is dangerous to confuse the different levels,
to the point where every inspired man is considered to be
a prophet or seer; we could never clearly perceive the
word of God. We need not deny the existence of great
visionaries - or underrate their importance - even when
we affirm that they are, after all, not prophets.
<p> The Torah distinguishes Yosef's dreams from the
prophetic dreams of Avraham, Yitzchak, and Ya'akov. The
Patriarchs' dreams appear as pathways to divine
revelation. In the Covenant between the Halves (berit
bein ha-betarim), Avraham first sleeps and has a vision,
and then receives God's word (Bereishit 16:12- 13; 17-
18). Ya'akov has a dream in which he sees a ladder and
angels, and then God speaks to him. In Yosef's dreams,
however, there is no outward prophecy or Divine
revelation. Even in Yosef's solving of dreams, there is
only a general feeling of prophecy:
<blockquote>
Solutions come from God; please tell me [your
dreams]. (40:8)
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Not I [but] God will answer for Pharaoh's well-
being. (41:16)
</blockquote>
<p> Only after completing his explanation does Yosef
become more confident:
<blockquote>
God is committed to doing this, and God will do it
quickly. (41:39)
</blockquote>
<p> It is significant that Yosef uses God's universal
name "E-lokim," and not the Tetragrammaton or Kel
Shakkai, names God uses when He reveals Himself to
Israel.
<p> For all the parallels the Midrash draws between
Ya'akov and Yosef (Bereishit Rabba 84:6), the Torah
clearly differentiates the dreams of one from those of
the other. This distinction draws a dividing line between
the degree of revelation shown to the Patriarchs, on the
one hand, and to Yosef and his brothers, on the other.
<p> Clearly, Yosef's dreams are prophetic, and not mere
nonsense. However, they are a form of ruach ha-kodesh
(holy inspiration), rather than nevu'a (prophecy; see
Maimonides' Guide to the Perplexed II:45, where he
specifically mentions Yosef as being on the "second
level" of prophecy; see also Akedat Yitzchak ad loc.).
Ya'akov himself provides the appropriate response to
Yosef's dreams:
<blockquote>
His father was angry at him and said: "What is this
dream you dreamt? Shall I and your mother and
brothers come and bow down to you?" ... but his
father awaited it. (Bereishit 37:11)
</blockquote>
<p>R. Levi adds:
<blockquote>
He (Ya'akov) took pen in hand and wrote down on what
date, at what time, and at what place. (Ber. Rabba,
84:11)
</blockquote>
<p> Dreams like this are precisely the kind of
experience about which the Akedat Yitzchak writes, "Let
the Giver of dreams provide their solution." These dreams
are not granted in order to be put into action by the
dreamer. Together with the sheer experience of prophecy,
these dreams grant us the power to wait. A dream which
comes true without our active involvement is one that we
can acknowledge, after the fact, as a prophetic dream.
Only an outright prophecy, such as God's word to Gideon,
should lead to action without first waiting. Certainly,
only an outright prophecy can suspend a commandment, and
only as a temporary measure (see Rambam, Yesodei HaTorah,
ch. 9); it is unthinkable that a dream, the outcome of
which is still uncertain, should suspend the fulfillment
of a commandment even temporarily. Nevertheless, it is
clear that Ramban considers these dreams to be full-
fledged prophecies. This position is diametrically
opposed to that of the Gemara (Berakhot 55a).
<p> Even if we accept the Ramban's position on this
point, his explanation of Yosef's behavior is untenable.
The first dream was fulfilled when the brothers arrived
in Egypt the first time.
<blockquote>
Yosef was the ruler of the land; it was he who
provided for all the inhabitants Yosef's brothers
came and bowed to the ground before him. (4:26)
</blockquote>
<p> There were ten brothers then, excluding Binyamin,
who was at home. They had come to obtain grain - the
sheaves in the dream.
<p> The second dream is fulfilled when they bring
Binyamin and meet with Yosef at his palace for a meal,
honoring him and offering him gifts:
<p> Yosef came home, and they brought him the presents
they had with them to his house, and bowed down to
him. (43:26)
<p> After all eleven stars had bowed down to Yosef in
his own right, as second to the king of Egypt, without
any direct connection to the grain, their father's turn
comes:
<blockquote>
He greeted them and said: "Is your old father, whom
you mentioned, at peace? Is he still alive?" They
said: "Your servant our father is at peace; he is
still alive." They bent down and bowed. (43:27-28)
</blockquote>
<p> This painful scene, in which Yosef's brothers
prostrate themselves before him in their father's name,
and refer to him as "your servant our father," is the
fulfillment of the second dream, in which the sun and the
moon bow down to Yosef. The entire family (other than his
mother, who was no longer alive) has bowed down to Yosef,
albeit indirectly - in Ya'akov's case ? and without
realizing the full significance of their actions.
<p> This scene will repeat itself when Yehuda begs for
Binyamin's safety and refers to Ya'akov four times as
"your servant our father" (44:14,24,27,30-31). It must be
noted at this point that Yosef arranged this episode in
order to keep Binyamin in Egypt (since he could not
foretell how Yehuda would react) AFTER the second dream
had been completely fulfilled. The dreams had all come
true before Ya'akov's arrival in Egypt, including the
dream in which Ya'akov bows down to his son. In fact, he
does not physically bow to Yosef when they are reunited
in Egypt; none of the commentators suggest that he did.
<p> The Torah does tell us that when Ya'akov was on his
deathbed, Yosef came to see him, and "Yisrael bowed at
the head of the bed" (47:31). But it is not clear whether
his bowing is before Yosef or before God (Megilla 16b,
Sifri Devarim 6) - the simple reading suggests the latter
- and certainly, his bowing does not come about through
Yosef's initiative. It is precisely the verse cited by
Ramban in support of his contention which actually
contradicts his theory:
<blockquote>
Yosef recognized his brothers, but they did not
recognize him. He remembered the dreams he dreamt
and told them: "You are spies." (42:8-9)
</blockquote>
<p> It is clear that only at this point does Yosef
remember his dreams, as he suddenly realizes that the
first dream has been fulfilled (see Rashi to 42:9).
<p> Since Yosef remembers his dreams only when his
brothers arrive in Egypt, why did he not send word to
Ya'akov before that? As ruler of Egypt, it was certainly
within his capacity to do so.
<p> Ramban answers that the ten brothers' bowing down at
the first meeting was not the realization of the first
dream, as the eleventh brother had not yet bowed down to
him. Yosef's first dream, however, does not specify the
number of brothers making sheaves! Binyamin could not
have been in the fields with them at the time, as he was
eight years younger than Yosef and hence only nine years
old.
<p> Thus, even in a dream Yosef could not have seen
Binyamin working in the fields. Even if we accept
Ramban's assertion that these dreams are prophetic, we
may not distort the content of the dreams. The second
dream is never completely fulfilled, as Ya'akov himself
did not bow down to Yosef, nor did Rachel, who had not
been alive for many years. The family's economic
dependence on Yosef cannot be considered a literal
fulfillment of the sheaves' bowing down before him.
<h3 id='answer2'>Yosef wanted to know if his brothers
regret what they have done to him / Ramban, Aqedat Yicxaq, Avrabenel</h3>
<p> Ramban himself apparently realized the difficulties
inherent in attempting to coordinate the story of the
goblet with the dreams. He therefore proposes a second
motive for Yosef's actions at this point:
<blockquote>
The second affair, which he caused by means of the
goblet, was not intended to trouble them. Yosef was
afraid that they hated Binyamin, or were jealous of
their father's love for him as they had been jealous
of [Yosef] ... Perhaps Binyamin had realized that
they had harmed Yosef and this had led to acrimony
between them. Yosef did not want Binyamin to go with
them lest they harm him, until he had verified their
love for him. (Ramban, 42:9)
</blockquote>
<p> Abarbanel agrees:
<blockquote>
Even after Yosef tested his brothers by accusing
them of espionage, he was still not certain whether
they loved Binyamin or whether they still hated
Rachel's children, so he focused on Binyamin to see
whether they would try to save him. (chap. 42,
quests. 4,6)
</blockquote>
<p> In the words of Akedat Yitzchak:
<blockquote>
Yosef's intentions were evidently to see whether
they still hated him or whether they regretted their
actions. (chap. 42, question 2)
</blockquote>
<p> This second solution is no less problematic than the
first. First of all, we cannot avoid the feeling that the
exegetes are attempting to explain away what seems to be
an accidental outcome as a preconceived plan of events.
The Torah itself indicates that Yosef simply had wanted
to keep Binyamin behind, after their brothers had gone
home. Possibly he feared that they would harm Binyamin at
some point, as Ramban suggests, or he may have wished to
reveal his identity to Binyamin alone and discuss with
him plans for bringing Ya'akov to Egypt. He may even have
intended to force Ya'akov to come to Egypt by holding
Binyamin hostage. It might be that he simply wanted to
hear from Binyamin all that had transpired since he was
sold. He may have wanted Binyamin's cooperation in
establishing the tribes of Rachel as a separate entity.
But it seems utterly far-fetched that Yosef planned the
affair of the goblet so that Yehuda would intervene and
offer to be enslaved instead of Binyamin, forcing Yosef
into an emotional situation in which, losing his self-
control, he would finally reveal his identity,
<p> All of this indeed came about, but none of it was
premeditated. Yosef could not have intended to test his
brothers' attitude toward Binyamin. What would he have
done if, as was quite possible, they had accepted the
situation as God's will, as punishment for their sin, and
left Binyamin with him as they had left Shimon? Would
this have proven either that they were not sorry for what
they had done to Yosef or that they did not love
Binyamin? Does submission to the power of a tyrant prove
anything? When Avraham agreed that Sarah be taken by
Avimelech, did that mean he did not love her? She herself
did not object to this unpleasant means of survival in a
strange land (Bereishit 12:10; see Ramban and Ha'amek
Davar ad loc.).
<p> At no point in Yehuda's long speech is there any
mention of the brothers' feelings toward each other or
toward Binyamin. Yehuda's expressed concern is with his
"old father" whom they left behind, and who interested
the ruler so much. Ya'akov is Yehuda's last resort, and
Yehuda plays it for all it is worth, hinting all the
while at Yosef's responsibility for any outcome.
<p> Can we be sure that, had Yehuda not committed
himself to his father under penalty of "eternal guilt,"
that this outburst would have occurred? It can certainly
be taken as a sign of repentance in general. But it was
not evoked by any feeling of love or pity toward Binyamin
or Yosef, but rather by a feeling of responsibility to
his father.
<p> There are two explicit references in our story to
the brothers' attitude toward Yosef. The first is during
their first visit to Egypt; the second is after Ya'akov's
death.
<p> Yosef hears his brothers express regret at their
behavior towards him, when they had only just arrived in
Egypt. This regret is coupled with the realization that
all that is befalling them is a result of that behavior:
<blockquote>
They said to each other: This is our fault, because
of our brother;
we saw his suffering when he cried out to us and we
did not listen;
That is why this misfortune came upon us. (42:21)
</blockquote>
<p> Yosef restrains himself at this point, apparently
with some difficulty, and maintains his deception. At no
later time does he acquire any new insights into their
character. This confession was elicited freely without
any pressure whatsoever; they never imagined he could
understand them "because the interpreter was between
them."
<p> After Ya'akov's death, the brothers return to Yosef
fearing retribution.
<blockquote>
Yosef might wish to harm us. (50:15)
</blockquote>
<p> Most commentators believe that they then lie and
invent the story of Ya'akov's deathbed charge, in order
to save their lives (Rashi on 50:16; Ramban on 45:27).
Their bowing to Yosef at this point, knowing who he is,
may be considered the final fulfillment of the dreams.
<blockquote>
His brothers also bowed down to him and said: "We
are your slaves." (50:16-18)
</blockquote>
<p> In our attempt to understand Yosef's motivation for
waiting so many years, and then deceiving his brothers,
we have ruled out the desire for forcing the dreams to
come true - as "dreams come to us without our consent" -
and certainly do not justify torturing old and suffering
parents. Furthermore, as we saw earlier, Yosef remembers
his dreams only when his brothers appear before him in
Egypt.
<p> Testing their regret could also not have been the
reason, as he had already heard them express repentance
in his presence. He revealed himself later only because
he heard of his father's suffering. True, the brothers,
especially Yehuda, were found to be repentant. This was,
indeed, part of a master plan. But the plan was devised
not in Yosef's court, but in a higher domain:
<blockquote>
The brothers were occupied with selling Yosef, Yosef
was occupied with mourning and fasting, Reuven was
occupied with mourning and fasting, Ya'akov was
occupied with mourning and fasting, and God was
occupied with creating the light of the Messiah.
(Ber. Rabba 85:4)
</blockquote>
<p> When Yosef does follow his own initiative and asks
the chief cupbearer to intercede before Pharaoh on his
behalf, he spends two more years languishing in prison.
<p>
In summary, I
believe that our question outweighs all its proposed solutions.
<p> What, then, do I believe to be the correct
understanding of Yosef's behavior? The answer will have to wait until next
week's shiur. In the meantime, I invite readers to submit answers of their
own to parsha@etzion.org.il.
<p>
<h3 id='answer3'>Yosef thought that his father was involved in a conspiracy to sell him to Egypt!</h3>
<p>
Netzach613@aol.com: Maybe Yosef thought that his father was in on it- that's why he sent him to
find his brothers and then the brothers ambushed him. He had just received a
rebuke from his father about his dreams. He couldn't write home because he
thinks his father and his brothers were all out to get him.
<hr />
<p>
Rskrausz@aol.com: For many years my wife asked me this question each year as these parshios
were read. After much thought I think I have a solution which fits very
nicely with everything the Torah tells us .
<p>Yosef thought or at least seriously considered the possibility that Yakov was
part of the conspiracy against him.
<p>When he was sold it was by no means clear that all of the brothers would
continue as shevatim. As in previous generations one brother or perhaps the
sons of one mother would become the chosen people.
<p>Yakov publicly rebuked Yosef for his dreams and Yosef did not know that he
secretly "shomar es hadavar".
<p>Yakov sent Yosef on the dangerous mission to find out what the brothers were
doing. In fact the medrash says that they knew it was dangerous and credits
Yosef for still going. In retrospect Yosef may have thought Yakov was
intentionally sending him to the fate that awaited him.
<p>Yosef names his oldest child Menashe meaning as the posuk says that he
intends to forget all his troubles AND to forget his father's house. If Yosef
thought that he was rejected we can understand why he wanted to forget his
father's house.
<p>When he saw the brothers without Binyomin he may have suspected that the same
fate as had befallen him happened to Binyomin. Perhaps the Bnei Rochel were
to be rejected. Binyomin was at that toime a grown man with ten children and
could certainly have made the journey. He wanted Binyomin to come to Egypt
either to insure his safety or at least to verify that he was still alive.
It is only just before Yosef reveals himself that he hears for the first time
that Yakov thinks that Yosef was eaten by an animal (ach toraf toraf). At
this point he realizes that Yakov was not part of the conspiracy (perhaps
confirmed by Binyomin) and he immediately reveals himself and asks as to the
welfare of his father.
<hr />
<p>abu.z@att.net: Lichvod HaRav, Shalom!
<p>I think part of the answer as to why Yosef did not make
contact with his father Yaacov is found in their
relationship.
<p>In parshat Vayeshev chap37 pasuk3 we are told that
Yaakov loved Yosef more than all his other brothers. No
where does it say that Yoseph truely loved Yaakov.
Secondly, Yosef was seventeen, a grown man in those
days, not a child, yet he is still acting like one by
telling his father bad things about the sons of Bilhah
and Zilpah.
<p>Then later on Yosef tells his brothers of his dreams and
Yaakov rebukes him for it. The favorite son has now
been embarrassed in front of his brothers. He's been
rejected not only by his brothers, but by his father too.
Yosef is later carried off to Egypt and probably felt
that there really was nothing to return to. His mother
was dead, his brothers hated him, and his father now
chastised him in full view of his brothers. (and he may
have thought that if the brothers didn't succeed in
killing him this time what is to say that they would not
succeed the next time. Egypt was safe).
<p>Another point may be that Yaakov himself did not expect
Yosef to make contact with him. In Cap.37 passuk 14 it says: ...so he sent him
out of the valley of Hevron. Yet as we are well aware Hevron is not in a valley
at all. I believe what the passuk is really saying is instead of translating the
word Emek as valley it should be thought of as DEEP as in Amokh. Yaakov was
invoking the memory (and spirit) of those that are buried there, Avraham,
Yitzchak, Sara VeRivkah, to in some way accompany Yosef on the journey he was
about to begin. Both Yaakov and Yosef were in this together (although not on a
conscious level) and Hashem was orchestrating the symphony.

<h3 id='answer4'>Yosef wanted to teach his brothers a lesson of solidarity / Milton.Wakschlag@kmz.com</h3>
<p>
I suggest that the answer to your question is that Yosef, from the moment
he laid eyes on his brothers in Mitzraim, resolved that he would not reveal
his identity to them until he was satisfied that they had learned the
lesson of Arevut in the years since they betrayed him. On the eve of his
family's yerida to Mitzraim, Yosef felt that this family clan, currently
just a band of brothers and a father, would thrive as an "Am," and thus
survive Mitzraim, only if they had learned how to act towards each other
out of a sense of Arevut.
<p>
The story of the sale of Yosef gets things going by focusing on the
difference between Reuven's and Yehuda's responses to the brothers'
vengefulness. Both Reuven and Yehuda disdain murder; Reuven acts to save
Yosef out of a sense of fear ("I will be the one who gets blamed," as Rashi
hears him say) and Yehuda takes a pragmatic approach ("What profit is there
in killing him?"). Neither acts out of a sense of pure solidarity, or
Arevut. From that moment on, the Torah seems almost preoccupied with the
idea of Arevut and gives multiple subliminal messages about its importance.
First the story of Yehuda and Tamar. Why is it placed immediately after
the story of the sale of Yosef and how is it connected to that story? I
suggest that the answer lies in the fact that the Yehuda/Tamar episode
introduces the concept of "airavon" to Yehuda. Yehuda was almost undone by
an airavon that he left with his disguised daughter-in-law and, in the end,
both of them were saved by it. The sudden introduction of this concept in
the Torah is not coincidental; this episode seared the importance of a
pledge -- a secured obligation -- in Yehuda's consciousness.
<p>
Later, when Yaakov finally had to face the unavoidable necessity of sending
Binyamin with his brothers to Mitzraim, Reuven responds with his customary
defensiveness: "I'll bring Binyamin back, or you can kill my two sons," he
tells Yaacov, as if that were any comfort. Yehuda, though, has learned a
lesson: "Anochi a'arvanu; miyadi tevakshenu." "I will return him, because
I pledge myself to that goal, not because I fear the consequences of
failing; in short, I am his airavon." This strikes a chord with Yaakov and
he lets Binyamin go.
<p>
Yosef knows his brothers have learned the crucial lesson of Arevut only
when he is confronted by Yehuda after arresting Binyamin. That Yehuda
would stand up to the viceroy of Mitzraim to save his brother Binyamin out
of an expressed sense of Arevut -- in stark contrast to his behavior when
Yosef had been threatened years earlier -- tells Yosef unmistakably that
the mission has been accomplished and he can reveal himself, finally, to
his brothers and his father.
<p>
How did Yaakov know upon receiving word from Yosef what had transpired and
why Yosef hadn't contacted him earlier? Through the gift of the Agalot.
We are told that there was an "inside" message from Yosef to Yaakov in this
gift, because they had been learning the parsha of Egla Arufa when they
were separated. But what was the message? I suggest it was the message of
Arevut. What else does the ceremony of Egla Arufa mean if not the
collective responsibility of members of a community for each other? It's
not surprising that Yosef and Yaakov would be dwelling on these matters
when Yosef's turbulent confrontation with his brothers' divisiveness heated
up. And it's not surprising that Yosef would be thinking again about these
matters when that confrontation was resolved.
<p>
By the time we finish Sefer B'reishit, G-d's prized creation -- man -- has
come full circle: from Kayin's terrible outcry, "hashomer achi anochi" in
the beginning of the Sefer, to Yehuda's beseeching plea, "ki avdecha arav
et hana'ar" at the end of the Sefer. From separation to solidarity Now
we're ready for the story of a nation; on to Sefer Sh'mot.

5 Tevet 
<p>In my humble opinion the answer lies in an overlooked Ramban Gen. 46;27, I
quote from Chavel Eng. version: "It is my opinion, in line with the plain
meaning of Scripture, that it was never told to Jacob throughout his
entire lifetime that the brothers had sold Joseph. Rather he thought that
Joseph had strayed in the field, and those who found him took him and sold
him into Egypt. The brothers did not want to tell him of their sin, being
afraid for their lives, lest he be wroth and curse them as he did nto
Reuben, Simeion and Levi, while Joseph in his good ethical conduc t did
not want to tell him."
<p>Joseph did not contact his father because in that case his father would
surely have asked him what had happened from the time he sent him to
Shechem and he would have been contstrained to tell him the truth. But
then his brothers would have been cursed and he and Bnejamin would have
been left alone to carry on the tradition. In his behaviour with his
brothers later we see that he loved them and wished to carry on his
fathers heritage with them.
<p>His original plan, when he recognized his brothers, was to pretend he did
not know them, conspire to have them bring Benjamin to him to Egypt and
have them return to Canaan and carry on without him. And, of course, he
did not know that his father thought him dead and mourned for him all this
time. He must have reasoned that his father had forgotten about him.
Indeed so, since there is no evidence that efforts were made to find
him.In the end there would two Jewish nations, one in Canaan and one in
Egypt.
<p>What frustrated Joseph's plan was Judah's pleading. Joseph realized that
taking away Binyamin would cause his father to die, and that is noted
again and again by Judah in his pleas. He could not suffer that, broke
down and revealed himself.
<p>And this theory would explain the strange "meeting" of
Jacob and Joseph as the former arrive in Egypt, with the Torah emphasizing
Joseph's harnessing his chariot (47:29). And the rabbis in the midrash are
puzzled just exactly what happened, but they all agree that there was some
resentment on the part of Jacob. It is to be noted that all the meetings that
Joseph had with his father were formal and public--this one and at the end of
Jacob's life when he blessed his grandchildren. No intimate meeting between
Joseph and Jacob is recorded in the Torah. This was deliberate on Joseph's part
so that his father would never have an opportunity to ask him what happened.

<h3 id='answer6'>Yosef wanted to complete his mission / Rony Shapira [rony_sha@netvision.net.il]</h3>Yosef was sent by Yaakov to "find his
brothers". This could mean find the brotherhood that should be upon them. As far
as Joseph is concerned he had a job to do. He may have felt that telling his
father about what happened to him could jeopardize with the mission. Only after
he was sure that he "found his brothers" he felt free to notify his father.

I don't know why he did not tell his father. But, it appears that he treated
his father as Jacob had treated his parents. Although Jacob was with Laban
for 20 years, he never sent word to his parents that he was alive and well.
This was apparently wrong and, as a consequence, Joseph did not tell his
father that we was alive and well while he was in Egypt - midah k'neged midah.

<p>Sol Zalcgendler [soloz@juno.com]: Thank you for "The Intractable Question".
A few points and an attempt at a solution:
<p>
<p>1. You state "All of this came about but none of this was premeditated".
Yosef could not have intended to test his brothers' attitude towards
Binyajim.
<p>	Could he not see it as a test and if they did not attempt to protect
Binyamin he would act. Yes he didn't know what Yehuda would do and it
proved to move him. and he no longer had to feel as Binyomin's protector
- because Yehuda took RESPONSIBILITY. The first time a brother spoke up
for a brother.
<p>
<p>2. "Why did Yosef not send word to his father?"
<p>Early answer -
(appropriate to Yosef in Egypt) because the last time he was with Yaakov
he sent Yosef to his brothers. Yosef could have felt his father had a
part in what happened to him.
<p>Later answer - (appropriate for visits of brothers to
Yosef as Egyptian viceroy and after Yakov is reunited with him). Because Yaakov
would have destroyed the family if he was told explicitly what the brothers had
to say.
<p>Sincerely,<br />
