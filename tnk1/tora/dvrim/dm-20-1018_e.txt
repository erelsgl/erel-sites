Deuteronomy 20:10-18 :

“When you draw near a city to wage war against it, you shall call out to it for peace. 

It shall be that if it responds to you in peace and opens for you, then the entire people found within it shall be as tribute for you, and they shall serve you. 

But if it does not make peace with you, but makes war with you, you shall besiege it. Hashem shall deliver it into your hand, and you shall smite all its males by the blade of the sword. Only the women, the small children, the animals, and everything that will be in the city - all its booty - may you plunder for yourselves; you shall eat the booty of your enemies, which Hashem, your G-d, gave you. 

So shall you do to all the cities that are very distant from you, which are not of the cities of these nations. But from the cities of these peoples that Hashem, your G-d, gives you as an inheritance, you shall not allow any person to live. Rather you shall utterly destroy them: the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivvite, and the Jebusite, as Hashem, your G-d, has commanded you, so that they will not teach you to act according to all their abominations that they performed for their gods, so that you will sin to Hashem, your God.” (Artscroll) 

Interpretation: 

 * "_When_ you draw near a city to wage war against it...": The passage does not mention the reason for the war, and whether or not it is permitted to have a war whenever we want to or only under specific conditions and circumstances. This question is a whole other debatable question. Anyway, if a decision to wage war has been taken - whatever the reason may be - we must do so according to the laws that are detailed in this biblical passage. 

 * "When you draw _near_ a city to wage war against it, you shall call out to it for peace": We must call out for peace only when we approach the city. We cannot be satisfied only with a general call for peace to all the cities together, because naturally a person cannot be aware of danger until it is really close to him. If we call out to a city for peace when we are far away from it - it is probable that it will refuse, and it is normal and we cannot blame it for that. If we call out to a city for peace when we are close to it - there are more chances that she will agree to it. 

 * "...Draw near a _city_ to wage war against it, you shall call out to it for peace": The Bible teaches us that to differentiate between cities. A city in biblical times had residents in the amount of a few hundreds to a few thousand people, namely - like a neighbourhood or a village nowadays. Namely: on one hand, the Bible does not require us to judge each member of the adversary-nation individually, nor to call out for peace to every single person, because this would be impossible. However, on the other hand, the Bible does obligate us to consider each city as a separate entity. Even if the majority of a certain nation, state (or “Authority”) is our enemy - we are still obligated to treat each city individually, and to give each city the opportunity to make up with us separately. 

 * "It shall be that if it responds to you in _peace_": The first possibility that the Bible presents is - that the city will respond positively to our offer for peace. Usually, when there are two possibilities, the favoured and ideal possibility is introduced first. This is also demonstrated in the passage about the blessings and the curses - first of all the blessings are mentioned (“and it will be that if you listen to Hashem, your G-d, ... and these blessings shall come upon you...”), in other words: if you obey G-d - everything will be well. If not - then we will find a way to solve the problem... Here, as well, the ambition is that the city will agree to make up with us. If it agrees - everything will be well. If not - then we will already think about how to react next... 

 * "And opens for you, then the entire people found within it shall be as tribute for you, and they shall serve you": But with the entire goal of the Bible to achieve peace - it does not allow for unconditional peace. Precisely due to the fact that peace is so important to the Bible, it is not satisfied with peace as a nice word written on paper. The Bible insists on actions, which will prove that the opponent-city really is interested in achieving peace. The Bible requires three deeds: 

   *   "And opens for you": The city must allow soldiers from the Israeli Defence Forces to enter it. 
   *   "As tribute for you": The residents of the city must pay us taxes. The Bible does not exactly qualify the tax. Therefore, we can request monetary tax, as well as taxes under the form of property; for example, nowadays it is reasonable to require that a city that makes up with us should pay us “taxes” under the form of weapons (namely, to hand over all the fire-arms that exist there). 
   *   "And they shall serve you": The residents of the city must perform work for us. Here as well the Bible does not exactly qualify the kind of work; apparently it means some kind of service that benefits the conquering nation. It is reasonable to request from them work that we need, and that they have the ability to do better than us, such as - capturing terrorists and handing them over to Israel. 


 * "But if it does not make peace with you, but makes war with you": If the city does not make peace, there is only one more possibility - which is that it will fight us, and if not immediately, then later on. There is no third way to solve the problem; there is no possibility of “cold war” in our region. 

 * "You shall besiege it": The first step in carrying out a war is to besiege the city. In another place in the Bible (either in the Written or Oral one) the laws of sieges are described: we must siege a city only on three sides, in order to allow for people to escape (according to Mimonides: The Laws of Kings and Their Wars, 6:16); we are not allowed to cut fruit-bearing trees for the purpose of the siege, etc. Anyway, the main point is to put the city under siege - not to leave it, because if it does not make peace with you it will surely make war with you. 

 * "Hashem shall deliver it into your hand": If we follow the laws of this passage perfectly - G-d will deliver the city into our hands. There is nothing to fear - not the city, not the “Authority” and not the “world”. 

 * "And you shall smite all its _males_ by the blade of the sword. Only the women, the _small children_, the animals, and everything that will be in the city - all its booty - may you plunder for yourselves": It is necessary to kill all the “males”, and to keep the “women” and “small children” alive. According to this interpretation, “male” means all the men who are capable to function independently, without being taken care of. We must kill all of these men, in order to totally neutralize the ability of the city to fight in the coming years and in the near future. 

 * "All its booty - may you plunder for yourselves; you shall eat the booty of your enemies, which Hashem, your G-d, gave you": We are permitted to take the booty of the city. It serves as compensation for the fact that the city caused us to fight. The Bible discusses the issue of how to treat captives elsewhere. For example: if someone sees a beautiful woman who was captured and would like to marry her - he must first allow her to mourn for her family during a whole month, and only then - if he still desires her - may he marry her. Anyway, he is not allowed to use her or to sell her as a maid. 


The last part of this biblical passage refers specifically to a special law that was established against the seven nations that lived in Canaan at that time. These were nations which committed bad deeds and which were known in a dark light, therefore, the Bible commands us to kill not only their males, but also the women and the children, so that they do not influence us negatively. Nowadays, thank G-d, these nations do not exist and therefore this commandment is no longer relevant for us.
