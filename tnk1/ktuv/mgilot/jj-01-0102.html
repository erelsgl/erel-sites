<br /> * “The song of songs which is Solomon’s. May He kiss me with the kisses of His mouth for Your love is better than wine.” (Song of Songs, 1:1 &amp; 2) *
<br />
<br /> The Song of Songs is the first of the Five Scrolls in the section of
<br /> Ketuvim, in the Jewish Scriptures. It is read in Synagogue on Passover, and in Sfaradi households every Friday night. On a literal level, this text
<br /> seems like a chain of love letters between a king and his beloved. In order
<br /> to justify the presence of such an erotic poem in the biblical canon, many
<br /> interpretations have been invented for it. For the Jews, it represents G-d
<br /> who is the King and the people of Israel as the beloved, expressing their
<br /> love for each other. For Christians, it symbolizes the love of Christ for
<br /> his Church. According to the history of literature, it is appropriate for
<br /> the ancient Israeli community to have such a song, as it is similar to
<br /> Egyptian, Sumerian and Mesopotamian love songs. The Hebrew style in which the Song of Songs is written resembles the one that was used around 400 BCE,
<br /> when Aramaic was the most prominent in the Land of Israel. Many artists, especially literary figures, painters and composers, have been inspired by the romance and majesty in the Song of Songs. (Encyclopaedia Judaica) It is so special that it even influenced St. John of the Cross to compose a similar love song entitled Spiritual Canticle. The first two verses of the Song of Songs are perhaps the most heartening. Therefore, this research paper will examine how exegetes have elucidated them, throughout the course of history. Solomon, whose name is mentioned in the first verse, seems to be an important biblical figure, and accordingly, a comparison of his representation in the three holy Scriptures will be made in this essay.
<br /> This exquisite segment of biblical literature is crowned by the title “The
<br /> Song of Songs”. One may wonder why such a special name was given to it (rather than plainly calling it: Song) and what it is supposed to express.
<br /> Many interpreters have taken a fancy to this passage and have done their
<br /> best to unlock its mystery. In Midrash Rabbah, Rabbi Akiva declares: “The entire universe is unworthy of the day on which the Song of Songs was given to Israel. All the Writings are holy, but the Song of Songs is the holy of holies.” (1:11 - p. 31) Other Sages of Midrash Rabbah think that Song of Songs means “The best of songs, the most of songs, the finest of songs.” (1: 11 - p. 33) This statement appears to be accurate, as the Song
<br /> of Songs happens to be many readers’ favourite biblical text. Since people usually strive for the best and for the closest they can get to perfection, no one would be satisfied with reducing their taste to choose something of inferior quality. Rabbi Yochanan, in the name of Rabbi Acha who spoke in the name of Rabbi Shimon Bar Aba, claims that the word song is repeated because there is reciprocal praise between G-d and the Israelites, unlike the other biblical songs, which are also holy, where the author expresses appreciation towards G-d for performing a miracle. (Midrash Rabbah 1:11- p. 33) The Talmud repeats these ideas and adds some of its own. The Tractate of Sanhedrin emphasizes how holy the Song of Songs is in comparison with other songs, by saying that “he who recites a verse of the Song of Songs and treats it as if it were a secular song brings evil upon the world.”
<br /> (Apstein, 3) The name Song of Songs proves that Solomon composed three songs:song that equals one, plus, songs that equals two (1+2=3). (Apstein, 4) Another view is that this song is the best one out of King Solomon’s 1005 songs (I Kings 5:12) (Mezudat David-Mikraot Gedolot, 3) Rashi states that this is the “song that excels all songs dedicated to G-d”. (Scherman, 68)
<br /> St. Bernard thinks that this Scripture is called Song of Songs because “of
<br /> its unique and because of the fact that it is dedicated to the
<br /> King of kings who is also Lord of lords. (23) The idea that this is a “most
<br /> supreme song,” because of the dual grammatical structure, was also expressed
<br /> by Ibn Aknin. (Scherman, 68)
<br /> Rabbi Alshich, who lived in a period when the Jews were weary of the exile,
<br /> especially since it was immediately after the Spanish Inquisition, used
<br /> wishful thinking in his commentary. For him, this song reigns over two other
<br /> songs that Solomon wrote, namely Psalm 30 (which represents Abraham and the
<br /> First Temple) and Psalm 127 (which represents Isaac and the Second Temple).
<br /> Rabbi Alshich believes that the Song of Songs refers to Jacob and to the
<br /> final redemption, during which G-d will build an everlasting Third Temple.
<br /> Another interpretation of his is borrowed from the Targum: there are ten
<br /> songs. Each one describes one of G-d’s qualities, while the Song of Songs
<br /> praises all of G-d’s “holy attributes”. Therefore, all of the other songs
<br /> are, in a way, included in the Song of Songs. (44-46)
<br /> The Netziv (Chaim Soloveitchik’s grandfather) brings forward unique ideas.
<br /> He writes that the first verse indicates that the Song of Songs is made up
<br /> of many short songs by a few different authors, which were compiled by
<br /> Solomon to express his own emotions. For him, the verse in I Kings means
<br /> that verses from five Psalms benefited from Solomon’s literary talent, and
<br /> that the thousand songs refer to an entire masterpiece, namely Song of
<br /> Songs. (1-3)
<br /> Rabbi Shmuel Yerushalmi expressed some original thoughts. For him, the
<br /> entire Bible is a song and it is understandable through physical senses. The
<br /> Song of Songs is special because one must possess a wealth of knowledge and
<br /> wisdom in order to comprehend it, because it is written metaphorically.
<br /> Because of the fact that he calls the Torah itself a song, he thinks that
<br /> the verse in I Kings means that the Song of Songs is based on the Five Books
<br /> of the Torah. He also informs the readers that the first letter in the Song
<br /> of Songs is usually enlarged to show that this is the greatest song, just as
<br /> “Solomon was greater in wisdom than any other man”. Another option is that
<br /> this song (shir) relates to five songs (hashirim: the letter hey
<br /> representing the number 5) that King David recited about the similarities
<br /> between G-d and the soul. According to him, there is a Midrash that informs
<br /> us that the Song of Songs was recited on the day that the First “Temple was
<br /> consecrated...the Ark was placed in the Holy of Holies, and the Divine
<br /> Presence filled the House of G-d, forever after making this the holiest site
<br /> on earth.” At that time, the love that was described in the Song of Songs
<br /> was represented physically in the world by the two Cherubim on the Ark,
<br /> which turned to face each other “in a gesture of love”. For him, the Song of
<br /> Songs is important because it teaches us how to accomplish the commandment
<br /> of loving G-d with all the heart and soul (Deuteronomy 6:5, the Shema).
<br /> (3-8)
<br /> Yair Zakovitz, a modern scholar, agrees with the idea of the superlative,
<br /> and therefore, thinks that this is the best song ever written. He claims
<br /> that this whole piece is only one song and that according to the definition,
<br /> a song is poetry with rhythm, that may be associated with happiness and
<br /> music. (45) Fox agrees with this definition, as for him, Song of Songs must
<br /> mean “most musical of songs, most harmonious of songs, the sublime song.”
<br /> (96)
<br /> The second part of the first verse, “which is Solomon’s”, is also very
<br /> intriguing. The Midrashic Rabbis argue extensively about who deserves the
<br /> authorship of this poetic masterpiece. Rabbi Nathan believes that G-d
<br /> himself recited the Song of Songs, supporting his thesis by saying that
<br /> Shlomo means King to Whom Peace Belongs. (Midrash Rabbah 1:12 - p. 35)
<br /> Basing himself on the words of the Sages, Scherman elaborates on this topic
<br /> by comparing this verse to the first verses of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes,
<br /> where King Solomon described his ancestry as the “Son of David”, unlike here
<br /> where the word Shlomo is alone and therefore means: King to Whom Peace
<br /> Belongs. (69) Rabbi Yodan and Rabbi Levy, quoting Rabbi Yochanan, tried to
<br /> convince people that whenever the scroll mentions “King Shlomo” it refers to
<br /> King Solomon and that when the word “King” appears alone it refers to G-d.
<br /> The Sages believed that “King Shlomo” refers to the King to Whom Peace
<br /> Belongs, namely G-d, and that “King” refers to Knesset Yisrael. (Midrash
<br /> Rabbah 1:11 - p. 33) Another Talmudic possibility is that this book was
<br /> dedicated as holy “to whom peace belongs”. (Apstein, 4) Raban Gamliel
<br /> claimed that it was the ministering angels who recited the Song of Songs.
<br /> (Midrash Rabbah 1:12 - p. 35)
<br /> After this period, there was no doubt that the Song of Songs was a product
<br /> of King Solomon’s pen, until modern scholarship emerged. From the Talmud we
<br /> learn that Solomon was rewarded for studying the Bible, with a Holy Spirit
<br /> that descended upon him and allowed him to write three books, namely Song of
<br /> Songs, Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. (Apstein, 4) There are two books in
<br /> Pseudepigrapha that are also attributed to King Solomon. They are the Wisdom
<br /> of Solomon and the Chants of Solomon, where chapter 17, for example, begins
<br /> with: “Chant of Solomon as a song, to the King.” (Hartum, 157) This chant
<br /> praises G-d, the King of Israel. Therefore, it seems to be similar to the
<br /> Song of Songs, in that it was written by Solomon and dedicated to G-d. The
<br /> Talmud thinks that it is perfectly normal for Solomon to have written songs,
<br /> as a creative writing talent may have been passed down to him from his
<br /> father, King David, who also wrote poems. (Apstein, 4) This seems like an
<br /> intelligent idea, especially since there are rumours that Prince William has
<br /> inherited Shakespeare’s writing skills. From the Zohar, we learn
<br /> that on the day the First Temple was built, the world was crowned with
<br /> perfection, love and peace. Solomon wrote the Song of Songs in
<br /> order to capture all those qualities in writing. Thus, it is a love song “to
<br /> the King of all the worlds who is the source of...peace.” (Yerushalmi, 6-7)
<br /> St. Bernard preached that the Song of Songs is about peace and therefore, it
<br /> is appropriate for Solomon, whose name means peace, to be its author. He
<br /> thinks that Solomon was “inspired by G-d to sing the praises of Christ and
<br /> of His Church, to hymn the grace of holy love, the mysteries of eternal
<br /> marriage; and at the same time he gave expression to the longing of the holy
<br /> soul.”(22)
<br /> Rabbi Alshich gives reasons for why Solomon was chosen by G-d to compose
<br /> the Song of Songs. Solomon was the builder of the First Temple, an
<br /> period in Jewish History. Solomon knew that this Temple would be destroyed.
<br /> Therefore, he had to express comforting words about the end of the exile and
<br /> the era of the Third Temple, by stating that G-d’s love and attachment to
<br /> his nation is so strong that He will build a holy house to dwell in, with
<br /> His own hands. The second reason is explained through an analogy with the
<br /> cycle of the moon. There were twenty-nine generations between Abraham and
<br /> Zedekiah, the King of Judah during the destruction of the first Temple. King
<br /> Solomon lived during the fifteenth generation. Just as the moon gets fuller
<br /> and brighter between the first and fifteenth days of the month and then
<br /> diminishes, the generations got better and better, climaxing at Solomon who
<br /> was the best, and then deteriorated. The purpose of composing this song was
<br /> to make future generations feel better by proving that despite this decline,
<br /> the reciprocal love that G-d and Israel feel for each other has not
<br /> diminished. Another idea is that the Song of Songs was first sung by G-d at
<br /> Mount Sinai or in the Tent of Appointed Meeting, but was forgotten by
<br /> Israel. The Song of Songs is the portion of the Bible that was assigned to
<br /> Solomon at Mount Sinai to introduce to the world as an original biblical
<br /> work, under divine inspiration, and therefore, bears his name. This is the
<br /> reason that the word asher is used instead of le. Rabbi Alshich also says
<br /> that this is the “choicest among Songs” written by Solomon, because it is
<br /> the best one he wrote. (40-46)
<br /> Rabbi Shmuel Yerushalmi describes the Song of Songs as a song about peace.
<br /> During the reign of Solomon, there was peace in the land of Israel: “Judah
<br /> and Israel dwelt in security, each man under his grapevine and under his fig
<br /> tree, from Dan to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.” (I Kings 5:5) In
<br /> order to express his gratitude towards G-d for this tranquillity, Solomon
<br /> wrote “the Song of Songs to the King who...blessed His people with peace.”
<br /> G-d also sent Solomon to compose this as a comforting prophecy of Israel’s
<br /> return to the Holy Land. (7-8) Rabbi Scherman believes that Solomon is the
<br /> author, because only a person who is “holy of holies” can write “a book
<br /> which is holy of holies.” (xxxi)
<br /> Modern scholars consider the first verse of the Song of Songs as a title
<br /> that is not part of the original scroll. Gordis tells us why he thinks that
<br /> the Song of Songs has been attributed to King Solomon. Firstly, his name, as
<br /> well as the word King, are mentioned several times in the text. Secondly, it
<br /> is expected that Solomon would have spent time on holy and “spiritual
<br /> concerns.” (1-2) The reasons that Zakovitz presents are that Solomon had a
<br /> thousand wives and was therefore, an expert in the field of love, and that
<br /> the name Shulamite, that is sometimes used for the beloved, seems to be the
<br /> feminine version of the name Shlomo. In addition, the descriptions in the
<br /> scroll fit Solomon’s luxurious lifestyle. Nevertheless, Zakovitz uses these
<br /> ideas to sustain his argument that the first verse was added by an editor,
<br /> because no one with dignity would publish something that describes him as
<br /> this book does. (10, 11, 45) This explanation seems inapplicable, because
<br /> overall, from the Song of Songs one gets the impression that the main
<br /> character is majestic, well-liked, popular and endowed with qualities that
<br /> many people wish for. Bloch is another scholar who considers this verse as
<br /> an editorial addition and claims that it means “dedicated to” or “associated
<br /> with” King Solomon, instead of suggesting that it was written by him. Bloch
<br /> thinks that the word asher, which is an archaic form of the word she, was
<br /> added in by an editor to make the text look as if it was written during King
<br /> Solomon’s time. This is the only time it is used in the text. (137)
<br /> King Solomon appears in all three monotheistic religions’ Scriptures. In
<br /> the Hebrew Bible, King Solomon, whose mother is Bath-sheba, is one of the
<br /> youngest sons of King David. His original name was Yedidiah, which means
<br /> “G-d’s friend”. He was the king of Israel for forty years and the last one
<br /> to rule over the Twelve Tribes as a united kingdom. At first, he was
<br /> successful: “Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his kingship
<br /> was firmly established.” (I Kings 2:12) Solomon composed proverbs and songs,
<br /> and spoke of the trees and of the animals. He was a wise judge: “I have
<br /> given you a wise and understanding heart, such that there has never been
<br /> anyone like you before, nor will anyone like you ever arise,” (I Kings 3:12)
<br /> and was reputed as such within great distance: “they came from all the
<br /> nations to hear the wisdom of Solomon, [emissaries] from all the kings of
<br /> the land who had heard of his wisdom.” (I Kings 5:14) Solomon built and
<br /> sanctified the Holy Temple and had a luxurious palace. However, he
<br /> intermarried and had a thousand wives, which caused him to sin. Even though
<br /> in I Kings it says: “Judah and Israel were...eating, drinking and
<br /> rejoicing,” (4:20) the residents’ life was not very enjoyable under King
<br /> Solomon’s reign, as after his death they begged his son, Rehoboam, to
<br /> “alleviate your father’s difficult workload and his heavy yoke that he
<br /> placed upon us.” (I Kings 12:4) In the New Testament, King Solomon is
<br /> mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus Christ. (Matthew 1:6-7) The Christians
<br /> recognized the fact that Solomon had wisdom, but they did not admire it,
<br /> because for them, Jesus was superior to him: “...to hear the wisdom of
<br /> Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.” (Matthew 12: 42 &amp;
<br /> Luke 11:31) Nevertheless, St. Bernard admits that “King Solomon had wisdom,
<br /> glory, wealth and peace all in abundance.” (22) Marina Warner, a modern
<br /> scholar, states that Solomon, who is the “emblematic figure of male
<br /> wisdom...embodies Judeo-Christian ideals of masculinity.” (Buchmann, 152)
<br /> For the Christians, Solomon prefigured Christ, and they consider Solomon as
<br /> the author and lover in the Song of Songs, even though for them it expresses
<br /> Christ’s love for his Church. (Buchmann, 154) The Christians also believe in
<br /> a legend that the Queen of Sheba prophesied to King Solomon “that the cross
<br /> will bring about the end of the kingdom of the Jews.” (Buchmann, 161) King
<br /> Solomon is greatly appreciated by the Muslims who believe that he was
<br /> endowed with “wisdom and knowledge,” (Quran 21:79) and that he ruled over
<br /> the birds and the wind. He was a celebrity and the Queen of Saba visited
<br /> him. (Encyclopaedia Judaica) They consider him as “David’s heir,” (Quran
<br /> 27:16) who asked Allah to “grant me a kingship never to be attained by
<br /> anyone else,” (Quran 38:35) which demonstrates Christian influence. They
<br /> believe that Solomon was rewarded for being righteous, (Quran 6:84) and that
<br /> he never abandoned the worship of Allah, although the devils manipulated
<br /> people against it in favour of sorcery. (Encyclopaedia Judaica) In the
<br /> Quran, Solomon is special because he is able to perform magic, wonders and
<br /> enchantments, better than any other king. He also has djinns (spirits) and
<br /> magical creatures at his service. (Buchmann, 158, 159) Many of the Muslims’
<br /> views about King Solomon are based on the Jewish Aggadah, such as his
<br /> ability to speak with animals. This implies that the Midrash was famous
<br /> throughout the world, as well as widely read, and that the Muslims accepted
<br /> its content and had no creativity. It also shows that commentaries about
<br /> King Solomon may have been taught simultaneously to the biblical text, and
<br /> therefore, the writers of the Koran had some difficulty in differentiating
<br /> between biblical facts and interpretations, and as a result, included both
<br /> in their Scriptures.
<br /> The second verse of the Song of Songs is full of passion. According to the
<br /> allegorical translation in Artscroll, it means: “Communicate Your innermost
<br /> wisdom to me again in loving closeness, for Your friendship is dearer than
<br /> all earthly delights.” According to Rashi, it represents Israelites begging
<br /> G-d to teach them the secrets of the Bible directly and intimately. In the
<br /> Mezudat David commentary, it is written that the nation of Israel misses G-d
<br /> and desires to feel His affection. According to it, G-d’s love and his Torah
<br /> are better than any earthly comfort and therefore, the Israelites wish to
<br /> sense it again. Divrei Yedidiah writes that this verse was recited after the
<br /> exodus from Egypt, but before the Israelites got the Bible. It shows that
<br /> Israel aspires for direct communication with G-d, instead of through
<br /> prophets like Moses, a wish that G-d fulfilled at Mount Sinai. Shir Chadash
<br /> states that the Israelites yearn for some of G-d’s closeness, but not for
<br /> the totality of it, because G-d is so great that mortal people cannot bear
<br /> it all. According to it, through the second part of the verse, Solomon
<br /> wished to express that loving G-d is superior to the study of the Bible.
<br /> Chavatzelet Hasharon suggests that the Israelites wish to be sustained by
<br /> G-d with holiness and purity, because they suffer in order to sanctify G-d’s
<br /> name, and they are willing to do it because they love Him so much. A
<br /> Talmudic thought is that wine means the Torah and that your beloved ones
<br /> refers to the Sages. Therefore, as Rav Dimi says in the Midrash, the
<br /> teachings of the Sages in the Talmud are more precious than the words of the
<br /> Torah, because they complete it. (Shermann, 69-72) This statement sounds
<br /> arrogant and implies that the Rabbis think that they are superior to G-d. It
<br /> is possible that this interpretation was invented with the purpose of easing
<br /> the Jewish community’s conscience and winning authority about the fact that
<br /> the Mishnah, that was written by people, was becoming a legal document and
<br /> being studied more widely than the Bible, that was believed to have been
<br /> written by G-d. By saying that G-d recited this verse in order to express
<br /> the idea that the Talmud is more important than the Torah, Rav Dimi could
<br /> easily overcome a conflict against the new cult of the Karayim, which
<br /> declared that they believe only in the Written Law and refuse to live by the
<br /> Oral Law. Another explanation of the comparison between wine and the Torah
<br /> is that wine improves with time, as does the reputation of the person who
<br /> has been studying the Torah for the longest time. In addition, one can
<br /> notice if someone is drunk, just as one can realize that someone is a
<br /> biblical scholar. In addition, both wine and the Torah rejoice one’s heart.
<br /> Another interpretation of this verse is, that the Israelites, as G-d’s loved
<br /> ones, are better than the seventy gentile nations, because numerically, the
<br /> letters of the word wine in Hebrew add up to 70. Two commentaries to
<br /> explain why there is a change in person in the verse. Ibn Aknin says that it
<br /> may simply express a sudden “burst of passion” and Lekach Tov thinks that
<br /> during the first part of the verse, the beloved is addressing her friends,
<br /> while in the second part, she is addressing G-d directly. (Shermann, 69-72)
<br /> Ibn Ezra presents three possible interpretations of this verse. Firstly,
<br /> that any kiss is on the mouth unless indicated otherwise in the text.
<br /> Secondly, the beloved wants to be kissed more than once, because one kiss
<br /> would not satisfy her. Being the object of affection of the king makes her
<br /> happier than wine. Thirdly, the kisses are the laws and the Bible, and G-d
<br /> loves more than one nation, but He loves the Israelites most of all.
<br /> (Krinsky, 3-4)
<br /> According to St-Bernard, this verse expresses a desire for the Christ
<br /> himself to appear. The kiss represents peace and the Holy Spirit, and by
<br /> asking for it, the Church wants to gain knowledge and insight about the Holy
<br /> Trinity. According St-Bernard, there are three levels of Christ’s kisses (in
<br /> order of ascending holiness), namely, the feet, the hand and the mouth. Not
<br /> everyone deserves to be kissed by Christ’s mouth, but those who have already
<br /> had that privilege, are encouraged to try to achieve it again. The Bride
<br /> asks the Bridegroom to kiss her, because she loves him. The request is from
<br /> the bottom of her heart. This love is holy because it does not desire any
<br /> physical pleasure, only spiritual satisfaction. In the second part of the
<br /> verse, St-Bernard translates dodeicha as breasts. The first possibility that
<br /> he presents is that Christ “hast so fed me with the milk of Thy
<br /> loving-kindness that I have laid aside all fear,” and that each breast
<br /> represent one of the ways Christ expresses his clemency. The second
<br /> possibility is that when Christ kisses the Bride with his holy kiss, her
<br /> whole body is enriched, she conceives and her breasts fill with milk. The
<br /> last possibility is based on Paul’s idea: one of the Bride’s breasts is
<br /> called Compassion and the other is called Congratulation. Every time the
<br /> Bride receives the kiss, her breasts fill with these qualities, and thus,
<br /> her life improves. (24-34)
<br /> Rabbi Alshich talks about the kiss of death which leaders such as Moses
<br /> received, instead of being killed by the angel of death. Another idea is
<br /> that kissing is the second highest way for G-d to transmit a prophecy, and
<br /> that each Israelite who accepted G-d’s divinity at Mount Sinai, was kissed
<br /> by G-d on the mouth and promoted to the level of a prophet. Yet, before
<br /> being kissed individually, G-d kissed the entire nation of Israel together,
<br /> to show that a united gathering has more merit than a single person. When
<br /> one recites this verse nowadays, s/he shows G-d that s/he has not lost hope
<br /> or trust in Him, even though s/he has been exiled for long. Thus, when G-d
<br /> finally kisses the Jews during the era of the Third Temple, they will
<br /> achieve a higher spiritual level than at Mount Sinai. Rabbi Alshich explains
<br /> the transformation in the person of the verse, by saying that Israel is not
<br /> sure if it is worthy of G-d’s kisses, but that it is not worried about
<br /> asking for G-d’s love directly, because Israel is confident that G-d’s
<br /> affection for it never diminished. He also compares the couple to lovers,
<br /> who are at first, attached emotionally (love) and only later, physically
<br /> (kisses). This verse marks the transition for them, and the maiden is not
<br /> sure whether her beloved will also be comfortable with it, so she is
<br /> embarrassed to ask. Rabbi Alshich explains the second part of the verse as
<br /> follows: after one drinks alcohol, he usually falls asleep, and when he
<br /> wakes up, he no longer feels any of its effects. G-d is compared to someone
<br /> who is sleeping until the time of the Third Temple arrives. Unlike wine,
<br /> G-d’s love for us will not disappear because of this lengthy sleep. Another
<br /> possibility is that G-d can his kisses to affect strong and weak
<br /> people equally, which is better than wine which has more effect on the weak
<br /> than on the strong. (47-65)
<br /> The Netziv writes that this verse relates to the commandment of loving G-d,
<br /> in Deuteronomy. One can only fulfill this commandment if G-d thinks that
<br /> s/he is worthy of it and helps her/him achieve it, because love towards G-d
<br /> is perfect only when it is reciprocal. (4-5) This relates to another verse
<br /> of the Song of Songs, namely: “His left hand is under my head and His right
<br /> arm embraces me,” (8:3) from which one gets the impression that everything
<br /> has to be reciprocal and balanced in order to achieve perfection. On page 6,
<br /> the Netziv continues by saying that in this song, the Israelites are
<br /> compared to a woman, in order to show how great their love really is towards
<br /> G-d, as in Genesis it says “and your desire is for your husband.” (3:16)
<br /> Rabbi Yerushalmi relates this verse to the wish of the nation of Israel to
<br /> be redeemed by G-d Himself, because His love towards the Israelites never
<br /> passes away, unlike passion that is aroused by alcohol. We also wish to have
<br /> pleasure when talking about the Bible (the kiss). (9,20) This wish seems to
<br /> have been fulfilled, as special, pleasurable events, dedicated to
<br /> discussing, studying and competing about the Bible, are held often and
<br /> attract many people.
<br /> Two modern scholars try to explain this verse. Bloch thinks that a
<br /> ceremonious tone is used because the lovers like to pretend that they are
<br /> king and queen and address each other as such. (137) This sounds like an
<br /> explanation, because many people like pretending that they are
<br /> royalty, especially in romantic relationships, which is where the expression
<br /> “prince charming” may have originated. The other modern scholar who
<br /> addresses this verse is Zakovitz, who claims that the kisses the maiden
<br /> receives from her beloved taste better than wine. (47) This demonstrates
<br /> that for him, kisses and love are synonymous, which is not the best
<br /> philosophy. Expressing one’s love physically is acceptable, but someone with
<br /> emotional intelligence must be able to express it in other ways, too.
<br /> In conclusion, in my opinion, the Song of Songs is an piece of
<br /> literature, full of passion and wisdom. It has attracted a lot of attention
<br /> from interpreters and biblical scholars. In this research paper, I have done
<br /> my best to chronologically trace the history of the important things that
<br /> have been said about the first two verses of the Song of Songs, as well as
<br /> compared the light in which King Solomon is seen in the three monotheistic
<br /> religions. As a result, my appreciation for the Song of Songs has increased
<br /> and I feel a thirst to know more about this topic.
