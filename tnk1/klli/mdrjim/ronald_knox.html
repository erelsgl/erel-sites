<p>אחד האתגרים העיקריים בתרגום לשפות זרות הוא, איך לשמור גם על התוכן וגם על האמצעים האומנותיים. בתנ"ך, למשל, ישנם הרבה פרקים המסודרים לפי סדר א"ב. כשמתרגמים אותם לשפה זרה, זה לא פשוט לוודא שגם התרגום יהיה מסודר בסדר אלפביתי של אותה שפה.</p>   
<p>אחד המתרגמים שהצליח בכך הוא 
<strong>רונאלד קנוקס</strong>    (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Knox" title="Ronald Knox">Ronald Knox</a>). 
<a href="http://www.cormacburke.or.ke/node/880">בתרגום התנ"ך שלו לאנגלית</a>, כל הפרקים האלפבתיים  מסודרים לפי ה-ABC (באלפבית האנגלי יש 26 אותיות, וכמובן רק 22 מהן מנוצלות).</p>   הנה, לדוגמה, תרגומו לשיר "אשת חיל" (<a href="http://www.cormacburke.or.ke/node/883">ספר משלי</a> פרק לא): 
<div dir="ltr">
<strong>A</strong>    man who has found a vigorous wife has found a rare treasure, brought 
from distant shores. 
<br/>
<strong>Bound</strong>    to her in loving confidence, he will have no 
need of spoil. 
<br/>
<strong>Content</strong>, not sorrow, she will bring him as long as life 
lasts. 
<br/>
<strong>Does</strong>    she not busy herself with wool and thread, plying her hands 
with ready skill? 
<br/>
<strong>Ever</strong>    she steers her course like some merchant ship, 
bringing provision from far away. 
<br/>
<strong>From</strong>    early dawn she is up, assigning 
food to the household, so that each waiting-woman has her share. 
<br/>
<strong>Ground</strong>    
must be examined, and bought, and planted out as a vineyard, with the 
earnings of her toil. 
<br/>
<strong>How</strong>    briskly she girds herself to the task, how 
tireless are her arms! 
<br/>
<strong>Industry</strong>, she knows, is well rewarded, and all 
night long her lamp does not go out.
<br/>
<strong>Jealously</strong>    she sets her hands to 
work, her fingers clutch the spindle. 
<br/>
<strong>Kindly</strong>    is her welcome to the poor,
 her purse ever open to those in need. 
<br/>
<strong>Let</strong>    the snow lie cold if it will,
 she has no fears for her household; no servant of hers but is warmly 
clad. 
<br/>
<strong>Made</strong>    by her own hands was the coverlet on her bed, the clothes of 
lawn and purple that she wears. 
<br/>
<strong>None</strong>    so honoured at the city gate as 
that husband of hers, when he sits in council with the elders of the 
land. 
<br/>
<strong>Often</strong>    she will sell linen of her own weaving, or make a girdle for
 the travelling merchant to buy. 
<br/>
<strong>Protected</strong>    by her own industry and good 
repute, she greets the morrow with a smile. 
<br/>
<strong>Ripe</strong>    wisdom governs her 
speech, but it is kindly instruction she gives. 
<br/>
<strong>She</strong>    keeps watch over all
 that goes on in her house, not content to go through life eating and 
sleeping. 
<br/>
<strong>That</strong>    is why her children are the first to call her blessed, 
her husband is loud in her praise: 
<br/>
<strong>Unrivalled</strong>    are you among all the 
women that have enriched their homes. 
<br/>
<strong>Vain</strong>    are the winning ways, beauty 
is a snare; it is the woman who fears the Lord that will achieve renown.
 
<br/>
<strong>Work</strong>    such as hers claims its reward; let her life be spoken of with 
praise at the city gates.
</div>    והנה תרגומו ל"אשרי" (<a href="http://www.cormacburke.or.ke/node/882">ספר תהלים</a> פרק קמד): 
<div dir="ltr">(Praises. Of David.)
<br/>
<strong>AND</strong>    shall I not extol you, my God, my king; shall I not bless your name 
for ever and for evermore? 
<strong>Blessing</strong>    shall be yours, day after day; for 
ever and for evermore praised be your name.
<br/>
<strong>Can</strong>    any praise be worthy of 
the Lord's majesty, any thought set limits to his greatness?
<br/>
<strong>Down</strong>    the 
ages the story of your deeds is told, your power is ever acclaimed;
<br/>
<strong>each</strong>   
 magnifies your unapproachable glory, makes known your wonders.
<br/>
<strong>Fearful</strong>    
are the tales they tell of your power, proclaiming your magnificence;
<br/>
<strong>grateful</strong>    their memory of all your goodness, as they boast of your just 
dealings.
<br/>
<strong>How</strong>    gracious the Lord is, how merciful, how patient, how rich 
in pity!
<br/>
<strong>Is</strong>    he not a loving Lord to his whole creation; does not his 
mercy reach out to all that he has made?
<br/>
<strong>Joining</strong>, then, Lord, in your whole creation's praise, let your faithful 
servants bless you;
<br/>
<strong>let</strong>    them publish the glory of your kingdom, and 
discourse of your power,
<br/>
<strong>making</strong>    that power known to the race of men, the
 glory, the splendour of that kingdom!
<br/>
<strong>No</strong>    age shall dawn but shall see 
you reigning still; generations pass, and your rule shall endure.
<br/>
<strong>O</strong>    how 
true the Lord is to all his promises, how gracious in all his dealings!
<br/>
<strong>Prostrate</strong>    though men may fall, the Lord will lift them up, will revive 
their crushed spirits.
<br/>
<strong>Quietly</strong>, Lord, your creatures raise their eyes to you, and you grant 
them, in due time, their nourishment, 
<br/>
<strong>ready</strong>    to open your hand, and fill 
with your blessing all that lives.
<br/>
<strong>So</strong>    faithful the Lord is in all he 
does, so gracious in all his dealings.
<br/>
<strong>The</strong>    Lord draws near to every man 
that calls upon him, will he but call upon him with a true heart.
<br/>
<strong>Utter</strong>    
but the wish, you that fear the Lord, and he will grant it, will hear 
the cry, and bring aid.
<br/>
<strong>Vigilantly</strong>    the Lord watches over all that love 
him, marks down the wicked for destruction.
<br/>
<strong>While</strong>    these lips tell of the
 Lord's praise, let all that lives bless his holy name, for ever, and 
for evermore.
</div>    והנה תרגומו ל
<a href="http://www.cormacburke.or.ke/node/896">ספר איכה</a> פרק א:
<div dir="ltr">
<strong>Alone</strong>    she dwells, the city erewhile so populous; a widow now, once a 
queen among the nations; tributary now, that once had provinces at her 
command.
<br/>
<strong>Be</strong>    sure she weeps; there in the darkness her cheeks are wet with tears; 
of all that courted her, none left to console her, all those lovers 
grown weary of her, and turned into enemies.
<br/>
<strong>Cruel</strong>    the suffering and the bondage of Juda's exile; that she must needs
 dwell among the heathen! Nor respite can she find; close at her heels 
the pursuit, and peril on either hand.
<br/>
<strong>Desolate</strong>, the streets of Sion; no flocking, now, to the assembly; the 
gateways lie deserted. Sighs priest, and the maidens go in mourning, so 
bitter the grief that hangs over all.
<br/>
<strong>Exultant</strong>, now, her invaders; with her enemies nothing goes amiss. For 
her many sins, the Lord has brought doom on her, and all her children 
have gone into exile, driven before the oppressor.
<br/>
<strong>Fled</strong>    is her beauty, the Sion that was once so fair; her chieftains have 
yielded their ground before the pursuer, strengthless as rams that can 
find no pasture.
<br/>
<strong>Grievous</strong>    the memories she holds, of the hour when all her ancient 
glories passed from her, when her people fell defenceless before the 
invader, unresisting before an enemy that derided them.
<br/>
<strong>Heinously</strong>    Jerusalem sinned; what wonder if she became an outlaw? How 
they fell to despising her when they saw her shame, that once flattered 
her! Deeply she sighed, and turned away her head.
<br/>
<strong>Ill</strong>    might skirts of her robe the defilement conceal; alas, so reckless 
of her doom, alas, fallen so low, with none to comfort her! Mark it 
well, Lord; see how humbled I, how exultant my adversary!
<br/>
<strong>Jealous</strong>    hands were laid on all she so treasured; so it was that she must
 see Gentiles profane her sanctuary, Gentiles, by your ordinance from 
the assembly debarred.
<br/>
<strong>Kindred</strong>    was none but went sighing for is lack of bread, offered its 
precious heirlooms for food to revive men's hearts. Mark it well, Lord, 
and see my pride abased!
<br/>
<strong>Look</strong>    well, you that pass by, and say if there was ever grief like this 
grief of mine; never a grape on the vineyard left to glean, when the 
Lord's threat of vengeance is fulfilled.
<br/>
<strong>Must</strong>    fire from heaven waste my whole being, ere I can learn my lesson? 
Must he catch me in a net, to drag me back from my course? Desolate he 
leaves me, to pine away all the day long with grief.
<br/>
<strong>No</strong>    respite it gives me, the yoke of guilt I bear, by his hand fastened 
down upon my neck; see, I faint under it! The Lord has given me up a 
prisoner to duress there is no escaping.
<br/>
<strong>Of</strong>    all I had, the Lord has taken away the noblest; lost to me, all the 
flower of my chivalry, under his strict audit; Sion, poor maid, here was
 a wine-press well trodden down!
<br/>
<strong>Pray</strong>    you, should I not weep? Fountains 
these eyes are, that needs must flow; comforter is none at hand, that 
should revive my spirits. Lost to me, all those sons of mine, outmatched
 by their enemy.
<br/>
<strong>Quest</strong>    for consolation is vain, let her plead where she will; neighbours 
of Jacob, so the Lord decrees, are Jacob's enemies, and all around they 
shrink from her, as from a thing unclean.
<br/>
<strong>Right</strong>    the Lord has in his quarrel; I have set his commands at defiance. O
 world, take warning; see what pangs I suffer, all my folk gone into 
exile, both man and maid.
<br/>
<strong>So</strong>    false the friends that were once my suitors! And now the city lacks 
priests and elders both, that went begging their bread, to revive the 
heart in them.
<br/>
<strong>Take</strong>    note, Lord, of my anguish, how my bosom burns, and my heart melts 
within me, in bitter ruth. And all the while, sword threatens without, 
and death not less cruel within.
<br/>
<strong>Uncomforted</strong>    my sorrow, but not unheard; my enemies hear it, and rejoice 
that my miseries are of your contriving. Ah, but when your promise comes
 true, they shall feel my pangs!
<br/>
<strong>Vintager</strong>    who did leave my boughs so bare, for my much offending, mark 
well their cruelty, and strip these too in their turn; here be sighs a 
many, and a sad heart to claim it.
