<p style="direction: ltr;">The English and Hebrew translation
covers of the book, 
<em>The Biology of Belief</em>          by Dr. Bruce Lipton</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">&#160;</p>  
<p style="direction: ltr;">Hello
Dr. Lipton,</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">I was
one of the lucky people who had a chance to read your book, 
<em>The Biology of
Belief</em>         , translated to Hebrew. In Chapter 7 you used an expression that
caught my attention, referring to the “battle between the conscious and
subconscious” [translated from Hebrew]—i.e. the Great War that occurs in any
individual with a dominant mind. Your description of this battle and the terms
you used left me speechless … for, seven years ago I came across another script
that described the same battle that you described so specifically in the
seventh chapter of your book, and the amazing part is that the author of that
text used the same professional terminology that you yourself used; it seems to
me that one of the two authors “stole” the terms and concept of war from the
other, but there is only one problem: the first author published his book more
than three thousand years ago, while the second author never thoroughly read
and studied that ancient script, of this I have no doubt.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Dr.
Lipton, the script that I am now writing to you about was originally composed
in Hebrew by me, and is translated to English for your benefit (sadly, I am not
an English speaker). This script was collected from a long manifesto, which
revolves around the physical location of the soul. No, you did not misread
this: the physical, spatial location of the soul in this reality.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">One must
be courageous enough to admit that the word “soul” or its synonyms “spirit” or
“consciousness” may seem derogatory to a man of science, who will have nothing
to do with such concepts and flee their study as fast as he could. For beyond
the common and significant meanings it holds in our culture and tongue—this
word is meaningless in science, and has neither definition nor place in
reality. We all know how to describe it, and we use various and different ways
to do so and write books about it—but such are all written in our popular
tongue.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">In
scientific language, the word is abominable, despicable, and the reason for
that is quite simple: this common word has no definition in reality. Perhaps
this is why you grew tired of it, Dr. Lipton, and tried so hard to give it a
scientific meaning—in an attempt to animate an inanimate object, to attribute
familiar traits to it. You, Dr. Lipton, tried to materialize the soul—i.e. give
it substantial properties, and indeed, you managed to do so by referring to the
soul as “energy”.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">Dr.
Lipton, you have spent decades studying cellular biology and observed that
human cells have an envelope called a “membrane”, and on its surface are
receptors—proteins that connect the inner cell with the outside world. The
receptors receive input signals from outside the cell and, according to the
information carried by these signals, determine the biological behavior of the
cell’s nucleus, where the DNA double strands reside. In other words, this
strand is nothing more than a “hard drive” manifest with human traits. But the
“brain” that activates this strand and determines how it will work is in the
cell membrane, and more precisely in the receptors that collect signals—i.e.
information from their surrounding environment—and can fully control this “hard
drive” inside the cell and modulate its contents.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Thus,
the extracellular “information signals” are received by the membrane receptors
as hazy energy waves that connect with the membrane’s wave resonance and that
of its receptors. In this way, one can claim that the information obtained from
the extracellular environment controls the biological behavior of the cell, and
the information which reaches its destination in wave form is, in fact,
according to you, Dr. Lipton, the energy of our souls and thoughts.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">By doing
so, Dr. Lipton, you have animated the spirit, i.e. given it a scientific
definition based on definitions of matter and energy waves. However, you did
not consider the fact that the energy you refer to originates in matter, that
there is no energy without matter, no existence to an energetic wave with no
matter to cause its formation. You say that the soul affects our cells and
determines their behavior in the form of waves sent to the extracellular
membrane receptors, but the very existence of these waves attest strongly to
the existence of certain matter that induced their formation. Thus, we are back
at square one: where is this soul, exactly? Is there a wave that controls the
cell, and how does it connect to the soul, the mind, the conscience? Where is
the scientific definition of conscience?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">For
thousands of years of culture, philosophy was the only tool by which humans
could refer to the issue of the soul. Even Descartes, who tried to give a
scientific definition to the soul, only fixed the use of this tool by
utilizing, de facto, a philosophical language. Today comes a biologist, Dr.
Bruce Lipton, who tried to pull humanity from this fixation and claim that the
soul has more than a philosophical definition. For he has seen evidence of this
in the cell membrane, where receptors receive signals originating from outside
the cells, and these signals—and not the DNA in the nucleus—are what
practically manage the biological behavior of the cells. Were one to ask you,
Dr. Lipton, what could be outside the cells if not the soul? To which you
quickly and decisively answer: only the soul can reside outside of the cells.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">With
your precise and scientific language, you say that if you knock on a door and
hear a sound it means there’s someone else behind that door, but no matter how
clear this sound can be—it is not enough to yield a scientific definition of
the essence of the soul. I’d expect you, Dr. Lipton, to finish your study with
a confession that thus far, we do not have a scientific definition of the soul;
we can no longer point to its physical location, and we are embarrassed at
that. Unfortunately, Dr. Lipton, you did not have that intellectual integrity.
I am grateful that you have taken me and humanity on a new path and
perspective, taking us further away from the philosophic route which represents
our incompetence to understand the essence of the soul.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Dr. Lipton, the text I am about to show you is about the war of the
consciousness with the subconsciousness. It raises the interesting question:
how can there be such a close resemblance, to a level of full correspondence,
between two different scripts temporally separated by three thousand years? The
text, as I mentioned above, is derived from an essay about the physical
location of the soul; yes, you have read this correctly: 
<em>the physical
location of the soul in space</em>         . No more flimsy, cheap philosophy; if you
knock on the door and the soul answers it means that it exists right there
behind the curtain. This point is where the long essay takes off from. This
abbreviated introduction, however, only aims to stimulate and attract you to
the original script. Here is the script at your disposal:</p>   
<p style="direction: ltr;">____________________________________________________________________________________</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">&#160;</p>    
<p style="direction: ltr;">Once
upon a time, there were a people called “The Sons of Israel,” a nation that
exists to this very day. Let us review this term first: “Sons of Israel.” The
name 
 
<em style="font-size: 1.25em;">Israel</em>          is composed of two Hebrew words: éÄùÒÀøÈ–àÅì
(Isra-el):</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>éÄùÒÀøÈ</strong>          is derived from the verb to rule, to fight for one’s dominance
or reign over others. And whom may one fight and struggle against? The opponent
is the 
<strong>àÅì (
<em>El</em>         )</strong>         , commonly
misinterpreted as God, while truly it refers to the head at the top of the
pyramid—the self-conscious. Israel is the man who fights for control of his own
consciousness; and who does he fight against? He fights that very
consciousness, his own consciousness, which he wishes to dominate.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">This
interpretation depicts an uncompromising man who yields to nothing—not even to
his own consciousness. He is a restless man, who accepts nothing. Israel is the
man who is constantly struggling with himself—as well, his surrounding
environment. And for that he must pay a dire price throughout his entire
history.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">This
man, Israel, was one of the Israelites’ Founding Fathers, also known as Jacob,
who lived in constant struggle with his consciousness and did not let go of
anything, in himself or his environment. The description of his unique
character can be seen at the end of Genesis 32, where the man’s relentless
struggle against his consciousness is described to every details. This verse
tells the story of this combat:</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong><sup>25</sup></strong>         &#160;And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a
man with him until the breaking of the day.&#160;
<strong><sup>26</sup></strong>         &#160;And
when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his
thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.&#160;
<strong><sup>27</sup></strong>         &#160;And he said: 'Let me go, for the day
breaketh.' And he said: 'I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.'&#160;
<strong><sup>28</sup></strong>         &#160;And he said unto him: 'What is thy
name?' And he said: 'Jacob.'&#160;
<strong><sup>29</sup></strong>         &#160;And
he said: 'Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel; for thou hast
striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.'
<strong><sup>30</sup></strong>         &#160;And Jacob asked him, and said: 'Tell
me, I pray thee, thy name.' And he said: 'Wherefore is it that thou dost ask
after my name?' And he blessed him there.&#160;
<strong><sup>31</sup></strong>         &#160;And
Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: 'for I have seen God face to face,
and my life is preserved.'&#160;
<strong><sup>32</sup></strong>         &#160;And
the sun rose upon him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped upon his thigh.&#160;
<strong><sup>33</sup></strong>         &#160;Therefore the children of Israel eat
not the sinew of the thigh-vein which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto
this day; because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh, even in the sinew of
the thigh-vein.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">When I
describe an internal struggle of a man, any man, with himself, I in fact
describe the struggle of that man with his own weekness, even if he is aware of
it and tries to handle it. The fact that one faces one’s weaknesses does not
reduce the weakness in all its dimensions; on the contrary, the struggle will
further assure its existence and emphasize the magnitude of its influence on
one’s soul.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">A man’s
weak-spot is an actual factor with constant presence in one’s soul; he lives
it—or, perhaps, lives with it—every minutes, twenty-four hours a day. A well
known example of such a weakness is gambling. This is a mental disorder that
manifests in addiction to risk, forced gambling, games of luck, bets … this
kind of weakness is a man’s other side, the one that lives with him and
accompanies him anywhere, anytime. In literature, it has been referred to as
“the Shadow,” like a shadow that accompanies a person anywhere, anytime.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Jacob’s
weakness is his twin brother, Esau. The sibling that has shared the room of
life with him, that one that lived with him at all times and accompanied him
everywhere. Esau, in other words, is the physical incarnation of the other
side—the weakness that is around Jacob, but also within his soul. Jacob is
aware of that spot and tries to face it, and when he cannot come to terms with
its existence he tries to send it away.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">In fact,
Jacob spends most his time away from Esau, but “the other side” that Esau
represents always exists before Jacob, forcing its existence and making Jacob
face it. If you wish to identify this side and take a closer look at it—just
look again at the verse I quoted above, from Genesis 32, where Jacob’s
relentless battle against his own conscience is described, i.e. his battle
against his other side, Esau, who forced his existence on Jacob and took
residence in his mind.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">In other
words, Jacob was born into a world where Esau already existed. It is not
another perspective he was exposed to, but a joint reality, in which Jacob had
no choice but to live and cope with it.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Remember
that we are analyzing the name “Israel” which is composed of 
<em>two</em>          words:
Isra and El: to struggle 
<em>El</em>         , the top, the self-consciousness, the raw
material of the mind. But what is this raw material composed of? The answer to
that is 
<em>information</em>         . Thus, the struggle depicted here is the war for
dominance over the self-conscious, to manage the web of information it receives
from the universe.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">That is
the essence of Jacob, 
<strong>Israel</strong>         : the man who struggles to dominate the web
of information his consciousness receives, and there are two systems for
receiving and managing this information.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
first system is that of the Original Conscious Mind which receives the
information straight from the source, i.e. the infinite continuum of
information. That is the school of, if you will, the author of the Torah, who
tried to sketch the Original Picture over Seven Expansions (i.e. seven days of
creation, told in Genesis 1). Here, we are on the Fifth Expansion (the fifth
day) in which we are about to evaluate the dimension through which the Original
Conscious Mind of Man controls the information.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">[Note:
this text was taken from the fifth episode of the series “Seven Days of
Creation.” The screenplay was written in Hebrew. Some terms may sound awkward,
as they were reviews of previous episodes of the series, such as “Original
Picture,” “Original Conscious Mind,” “Seven Expansions,” etc. Nevertheless, I
believe this awkwardness should not diminish one’s capacity to understand the
text herein and its content.]</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
motto of this school is “
<strong>éäåä äåà àçã</strong>         ” in Hebrew, and while the
word éäåä is commonly translated to 
<em>Jehovah</em>         , God
is one, I wish to argue the author of the Torah had a different interpretation
when writing it in his text. The author meant the word 
<em>Yehaveh</em>         , which is
spelled the same in Hebrew but means 
<strong>to be one</strong>         : He is now and will
forever exist until the end of time, for all the information that the universe
contains is in a single continuum of information.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>éäåä (
<em>Yehaveh</em>         ):</strong>          that is the codename of the dynamic that operates through the
single, infinite continuum of information. It is the code name of the “single
weave” that Moses saw when he reached deep into his consciousness and revealed
its source. This is the source of the Original Conscious Mind’s domination over
the universe’s network of information, coming from the recognition of the
dynamic code of activity and information in space.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Information
that is connected by consecutive links can be defined. One can even settle in
its location and control it, since along the continuum we can identify
consecutive links of information with matching links that await them, to
connect them with the other continuous links in the chain, forever connecting,
identifying, linking … This gives eternal freedom to human achievements and
allows them to live and slide through space forever. This is the summarized
expression of the Original Picture and the essence of the Torah author’s
system.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Simultaneously,
Isra-El struggles with the second system, which settled in his consciousness
and was developed by Esau. Esau’s school rejects the first system’s motto and
renounces its meaning, claiming that there is no chain of information made of a
single infinite weave of consecutive links. The reality is the only chain of
information with spatial existence is proven, and everything else of the
unknown and unexpected, allowing the existence of doubt, uncertainty and fear
of the unknown, and these are, in fact, the two parallel sides of reality.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">According
to Esau, finiteness is Man’s fate, joined by coincidence and destiny, which
will either benefit or harm him. One should, therefore, grab life with both
hands and take what one can from this crazy reality, for all it means, because
either way catastrophe will eventually occur and death will be at Man’s door.
It takes a simple mathematic calculation to realize that eventually, Man will
yield before the threats and even destiny cannot be on his side for all times.
This is why Man should defend himself as much as possible from all the threats
that await him, since “offence is the best defense.” This is how the phrase “I
am—therefore I survive” was coined and stuck until today; it is the entire
survival theory in a nutshell, and the essence of Esau’s school—the main
competitor of the author of the Torah’s schooling, which naturally rejects the
Original Picture derived from it.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">I have
mentioned above that Jacob was forced to fight the second school of Esau, which
settled in his mind. The question is why was it termed “Esau’s school” if it
took such a main place in Jacob’s consciousness, as evidenced by his struggle
against it?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">While
the Torah tells in detail Jacob’s struggle against his consciousness, Esau’s
school stands at the center of this struggle in all three dimensions. This
documentation is provided by the end of Genesis 32, and I will review it
further, later on, but before that I must answer Esau’s question: why was the
system named after him and not after his brother?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
Torah answers this question in Genesis 25, and again chooses to leave the
solution to the end of the verse:</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong><sup>27</sup></strong>         &#160;And the boys grew; and Esau was a cunning
hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.&#160;
<strong><sup>28</sup></strong>         &#160;Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did
eat of his venison; and Rebekah loved Jacob.&#160;
<strong><sup>29</sup></strong>         &#160;And Jacob sod pottage; and Esau came
in from the field, and he was faint.&#160;
<strong><sup>30</sup></strong>         &#160;And Esau said to Jacob: 'Let me
swallow, I pray thee, some of this red, red pottage; for I am faint.' Therefore
was his name called Edom.&#160;
<strong><sup>31</sup></strong>         &#160;And Jacob said: 'Sell me first thy
birthright.'&#160;
<strong><sup>32</sup></strong>         &#160;And Esau said: 'Behold, I am at the
point to die; and what profit shall the birthright do to me?'&#160;
<strong><sup>33</sup></strong>         &#160;And Jacob said: 'Swear to me first';
and he swore unto him; and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.&#160;
<strong><sup>34</sup></strong>         &#160;And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage
of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way. So Esau
despised his birthright.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">From
this group of verses we can learn about the inner allocation each sibling
attributed to himself. In modern language this is called “personality
analysis,” and shows the tendency of each brother since the beginning of their
paths.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And
the boys grew …</strong></p>                  
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And
Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field;</strong>          from
the beginning, Esau leaned towards the second school and embraced it to lead
his life. There is no single infinite weave or continuum of information, with
consecutive links. Doubt and fear of the unknown exist, finiteness of Man is
part of his fate, and coincidence and destiny are what make the world go round.
Thus, if you wish to live life, you must grab it from the hands of destiny and
turn reality to your favor—by force, if you must, as the ends justify the
means.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And
Esau was a cunning hunter,</strong>          a man who can prey on
his sustenance, who can shred, rip, dismember… this is how he survives, this is
the way life has taught him.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>A man
of the field;</strong>          he is a tough man, a man of the
field, acknowledged for his strength and force.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And
Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.</strong>          Jacob
recognized the property of the information continuum from the very beginning.
The continuum is infinite and so he takes his sustenance from this continuum—he
did not have to devour it, since the links of information stay in their place
and all he has to do is reach out and take them, harvest them at his own
leisure and of his own free will.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Jacob
knows what he wants, when he wants it and how much of it he wants. He will not
pursue anything frantically, because everything is within reach. There is no
rush, no haste in his actions. He was a quiet man, whole, complete, even
decisive if you will. He is invigorated by the links of information and not by
the means of getting them. He does not concern himself about the means.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>Dwelling
in tents.</strong>          He simply sat in the tent and with his
hand, reached for life; quietly, peacefully, he had no need of charging at it
and ripping it straight from the field.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>Now
Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison; and Rebekah loved Jacob.</strong>          This verse is critical of Isaac but compliments Rebekah.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Isaac
only sees one side of reality; he can see that Esau knows how to handle life
and grab it; he admires and empathizes with that trait. We too, in our modern
time, think that a person who seizes life is gifted. We say this person is
“alive,” and that is indeed the case; but there is a thin line between the act
of charging at something, which is essentially positive, and attacking it—like
a madman, devouring and ripping at anything in sight.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">This is
why the author was right to limit Isaac’s love to a specific tense, and that is
the past: for 
<strong>Isaac loved Esau</strong>         , but then he realized the meaning
of Esau’s charge and noticed his aggressive side, saw the destrictive nature of
his hunter side. He finally saw the school from which he came, where he learned
how to prey—and realized his mistake.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And
Rebekah loved Jacob.</strong>          A woman’s intuition—she
recognized the source of Jacob’s innocence, saw his calmness and decisiveness,
and loved this trait regardless of temporal relation.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And Jacob sod pottage, and Esau came in from the field, and
he was faint.</strong>          This is a scene from life: Jacob and
Esau, each depicted with his occupation. The Torah did not consider it
important enough to detail the specific occupation of each of the brothers.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And Jacob sod pottage:</strong>          Jacob
created something, which is definitely a derivative of his occupation.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And Esau came in from the field, and he was faint.</strong>          Esau, at the same time, practices an exhausting, difficult, and
fatiguing occupation. We do not know whether he was a wealthy or poor man, but
either way he was exhausted, worn out, a man who was tired of the hardness of
life that needed to be devoured for every crumb of bread; life where one is
threatened or threatening, where you can either survive and live or crumble and
die. Esau lives on that level of existence, and that is the level of
difficulties he handled on a daily basis.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">All
while Jacob was dwelling in tents…</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And Esau said to Jacob: 'Let me swallow, I pray thee, some
of this red, red pottage; for I am faint.' Therefore was his name called Edom.</strong>          Esau sees Jacob’s creation and covets it. This is the way of the
predator: everything he sees is considered as prey that must be snatched
quickly before anyone catches it first. 
<em>Grab what comes your way today,
because tomorrow you, or your prize, or both may not be here</em>          – that is
Esau’s motto.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The way
of the predator is to take the prize—whatever it may be. He will not examine it
or evaluate its properties. It is a physical thing, and every physical thing
has its use.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>Let me swallow, I pray thee, some of this red, red pottage;</strong>          Feed me of this red thing, I care not for its content.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>Therefore was his name called Edom.</strong>          He was thereafter known for his carelessness, an empty man who
never cared for content, the man who only sees the shell, the cover. It is the
way of the predator to charge at anything without taking interest in its benefit,
for what does future gain have to do with seizing here and now? Finally, the
way of the predator is to become likable over his prey, and gain its trust. At
the end of the day, the end justifies the means when it comes to gaining on
prey, for this is the essence of life according to his schooling.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>For I am faint.</strong>          Have mercy,
friends, please have mercy. The Torah describes a typical scene from the lives
of the twins, Jacob and Esau, depicting the way of life of each of them, for
better or worse. Through this part we are supposed to identify the system each
brother belonged to since their youth, the beginning.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And Jacob said: 'Sell me first thy birthright.</strong>          Jacob, on the other hand, makes a business proposal by which he
projects the message that “I am no prey for you,” i.e. he will not be “a
sucker.”</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Herein
we reconnect with the “birthright” we encountered with Moses, whom we’ve met in
the expanded fourth picture. A 
<strong>birthright</strong>          is given to the first
offspring of a man, and therefore has a special status. He represents the
consecutive links of information, which the conscious mind meets for the
first time, and through which it tries to break through to the horizon. A 
<strong>birthright</strong>         
is the wheel, the business, the land, the light. He is the body that will spread
light in the pile of dark information and route the path of the mind to the far
horizon, the list of vision.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">So a
birthright is any idea, system, theory, thesis, assumption or principle, any
partial chain in which the human conscious mind first recognizes the sequence
of its links and sees it as a light, a source of luminescence that will spread
the light in space for it and guide its way to the rest of the information in
store in the eternal chain.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And Jacob said: 'Sell me first thy birthright.</strong>          For this is the deal that Jacob offered Esau in exchange for
Jacob’s creation, which Esau desired.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">While
Esau is a “man of the field,” he was surely also a “creative” man, a
knowledgeable man with ideas, perhaps even inventions. Esau is the son of Isaac
and grandson of Abraham, a dynasty of great importance in the world of
philosophy and creation, to say the least. On the other hand, Jacob is also a
man of ideas, theories, and hypotheses—he refers to any idea or hypothesis as
the birthright, as the light that will guide his way towards the vision he sees
in the horizon. And Jacob, who practices the school of the one infinite chain
of information, has a very presumptuous vision; so presumptuous, in fact, that
even the foreign glories could recruit to help and guide it, even the ones that
he did not create.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">And this
is the essence of Jacob’s proposal to Esau: you have ideas and creations, and
so do I. So let us cooperate together, exchange ideas and products: you will
give me your birthrights and I shall give you mine, since as you can see—one of
my creations was to your liking this very day. Jacob offered Esau a simple
proposal of trade.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And Esau said: 'Behold, I am at the point to die; and what
profit shall the birthright do to me?'</strong>          All along,
Esau is loyal to the principle of survival that, at the end of the day, does
not predict anything good for him. ‘Even if I can survive and defuse that which
threatens me, by simple mathematical extrapolation, I may still crumble and die
at the end of the work day, and if that is the case …</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>What profit shall the birthright do to me?'</strong>          What will all my ideas and creations do to help me? Esau
demonstrates contempt for his brother Jacob, who considers every idea as a
glory that guides the rest of the information. In today’s slang, one might
rephrase Esau’s response to the offer as “bullshit birthright.”</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Even on
the technical side, Esau does not let Jacob slide and jabs technical darts at
his schooling and philosophy. His jabs are phrased with contempt. The
birthright, according to your philosophy, is an idea that represents a partial
chain in which the conscious mind first identifies its links and considers as a
guide, the source of light that will spread the light for it in space and guide
its way to the rest of the information in the stacked, infinite, consecutive
chain. For I am about to die, and you are about to die, and we are all going to
die—that is our fate, that controls us and nature—so what consecutive chain are
you babbling about? Who will be around to enjoy its endlessness, its continuum?
Especially since the right-sided mind denounces the concept of continuum in the
first place, since only reality has a consecutive representation but the rest
of the information does not. What is left of the information is basically unknown,
and how may you reach it with your “birthrights”?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>What profit shall the birthright do to me?</strong>          Bullshit birthright, as I said. Esau concludes his speech: I am
fine with your offer regardless of the birthright, for this is just some
bullshit birthright!</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And Jacob said: 'Swear to me first'; and he swore unto him;</strong>          although even back then most people would shake to close a deal,
this was not the case when dealing with a predator. One must fill out forms,
provide guarantees, and swear before a witness; after all, business is
business.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And he sold his birthright unto Jacob;</strong>          i.e., the deal was on.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he
did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his
birthright.</strong></p>                  
<p style="direction: ltr;">In the
last chapter I discussed, be it intentional or not, the basic difference
between the two verb pairs—“buy &amp; sell” as opposed to “give &amp; take.”
Esau’s part of the deal was marked as a sale - 
<strong>And
he sold his birthright unto Jacob</strong>         , however Jacob’s part of
the deal was phrased as a gift: 
<strong>and Jacob gave Esau</strong>          … The
difference between giving and selling is tremendous, and those who wish to
further read about it should go back to the Original Picture in its Fourth
Expansion.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils;</strong>          as I said, this was not a single deal, but rather a package—and the
bread is mentioned herein to insinuate the other products that were included in
the agreement.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And he did eat and drink;</strong>          Esau
used Jacob’s products and/or ideas and was fully satisfied with them.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And rose up, and went his way;</strong>         
after exhausting the products, Esau left; no need to say that he did not
utilize them into a glory, as the author of the Torah says:</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>Esau despised his birthright;</strong>         
Esau despised Jacob’s birthright, but here the author corrects his mistake: it
is not Jacob’s, but your own birthright that you despise, for you were not wise
enough to use it properly.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">So, once
upon a time there was a people called Israelites, “Sons of Israel.” So far we
have analyzed half the term Israel—i.e. Jacob, the man who was at a constant
struggle to control his mind; and, with the help of the verses from Genesis 25,
we managed to expose where his path was leading from his youth, where his
conscious mind leaned to and what schooling system he belonged to.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">We saw
the school to which Jacob’s original “El” belonged to (the school of the
Original Conscious Mind), which Jacob the man also leans towards and directs
his mind to it. But will he succeed in this task? Will he be able to match his
conscious mind with the Original Conscious Mind? We still lack the other part
of his name: for “Isra” represents Jacob the warrior, and the question is how
will he conduct his struggle and what obstacles will he run into? And, of
course, will he be able to overcome them?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
following passage should be able to elaborate the meaning of the other half of
the term (i.e. “Isra”):</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong><sup>25</sup>&#160;</strong>         And
Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of
the day.&#160;
<strong><sup>26</sup></strong>         &#160;And when he saw that he prevailed not
against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's
thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.&#160;
<strong><sup>27</sup></strong>         &#160;And he said: 'Let me go, for the day
breaketh.' And he said: 'I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.'&#160;
<strong><sup>28</sup></strong>         &#160;And he said unto him: 'What is thy name?'
And he said: 'Jacob.'&#160;
<strong><sup>29</sup></strong>         &#160;And he said: 'Thy name shall be called
no more Jacob, but Israel; for thou hast striven with God and with men, and
hast prevailed.'
<strong><sup>30</sup></strong>         &#160;And
Jacob asked him, and said: 'Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.' And he said:
'Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?' And he blessed him there.&#160;
<strong><sup>31</sup></strong>         &#160;And Jacob called the name of the place
Peniel: 'for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.'&#160;
<strong><sup>32</sup></strong>         &#160;And the sun rose upon him as he passed
over Peniel, and he limped upon his thigh.&#160;
<strong><sup>33</sup></strong>         &#160;Therefore the children of Israel eat
not the sinew of the thigh-vein which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto
this day; because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh, even in the sinew of
the thigh-vein. (
<em>Genesis 32:25-33</em>         )</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">A few
years ago, I discussed Genesis 3, a chapter called the “Sin of the First Man.”
It was part of a long essay I wrote at the time, “
<em>Meyda</em>         ” (Information)
in 2007, I believe it was. Four years have passed and it seems many things have
changed—in me, in my writing. I guess my pen is sharper today, more direct and
simple, less sarcastic. It took me a long time to understand that simplicity is
a virtue in writing, while irony is a deviation.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Other
than the evolution of my pen, I have gained, in the Biblical level, a great
many virtues and terms; new terminology that I did not posses before. My
greatest accomplishment is two terms I have recently acquired: 
<em>Elohim</em>         ,
often misinterpreted as 
<em>God</em>         , is in fact the human consciousness of every
human being, or alternatively it is the Original Conscious Mind that the author
of the Torah addresses, directs us to it, directs Man to it. The second term is
<em>Yehaveh</em>         , also misread as 
<em>Jehovah</em>          (as we discussed earlier),
another name for God, which until I gained it I would meticulously write as
“G-d”. This term is the initiation code of the machine that is the universe, or
as I put it before—it is the dynamic that operates within the infinite, single
continuum of information. It is the codename of “the single weave” which Moses
witnessed when he finally reached deep into his consciousness and exposed its
origin.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">It is
hard for some to accept this drastic change in these two terms, but the change
formed in my mind gradually and I took it almost for granted, as it did not
strike be abruptly. To not take my words out of context, I refer to a change of
the professional literary terms only—professional tools that help one read and
interpret the Torah. To be even more accurate, I once thought that G-d Almighty
and the author of the Torah were one and the same, while today I know that the
author used the words 
<em>Elohim</em>          and 
<em>Jehova</em>          as terms to preach his
system.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">To
clarify, the Torah as I read it today, yesterday and four years ago did not
change in my mind, nor did the identity of its author. One thing did change in
this context: today I know that the author of the Torah did not want us to
discuss his own essence or quality, nothing other than the Torah itself. I know
this from a very simple fact: He does not mention a single detail about himself
in the book he wrote to us, to Man. I deduce from this that this is his will:
to not discuss his essence, his greatness, or any other value of him. He is
beyond the biblical discussion and out of context to the Torah and its content.
</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">Some may
say my reading of the Torah is revolutionary, but I think the real innovation
was the definition of the author’s will. Once everything revolved around his
powerfulness, his speech, his words, his size, his essence, his virtues, his
highness, his glory, his work, his profusion, his mercy, his rules, his
punishment, his grace … the entire picture we absorbed with our minds from the
Torah was all about his essence and this image was derived, as we understood
it, by his will, but this is the exact opposite of his will. his wish is to stay
out of the intellectual discourse that he proposes in his book. The book was
meant for Man and will discuss Man alone—and not any other entity. His will,
therefore, is that we will not discuss him, describe him or concern ourselves
with his essence—which is exactly what we 
<em>have</em>          been doing for
generations, describing him and touching his essence and talking about him and
for him.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">I do not
know the true identity of the author of the Torah. He is an entity of sorts.
This is certain, and cannot be Man—of flesh and blood like us. Perhaps he is
the same entity implemented in our minds and which we refer to as God, or maybe
he is an alien from outer space; the question of who he is—and all questions
derived from it (e.g. what he is, where is he, why him, what did he do, what
did he create, what did he produce, what is his essence, what is his will,
etc.)—are exactly what the author of the Torah asks us to refer to in a most
personal, intimate, conscious level, and no other. Each may have his
interpretation of him, and by doing so, he attempts to bring to an end, any
attempt to speak about him or for him.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
truth is, I was only planning to touch this subject and end my Saturday with
it, end the concluding Seventh Expansion. But this pen of mine brought me so
far, and who am I to resist it. In fact, I came to this topic when I mentioned
Genesis 3, called the chapter of the “Sin of the First Man,” which I discussed
four years ago in my essay “
<em>Meyda.</em>         ”</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Four
years ago I did not yet recognize the terms “
<em>Elohim</em>         ” and “
<em>Jehova,</em>         ”
and referred to them as usual. Reading Genesis 3 about the “Sin of the First
Man” in those eyes, I delved deeply into that chapter using the tools I had
back them—i.e. the old terms for “
<em>Elohim</em>         ” and “
<em>Jehova.</em>         ” Now I
mention Genesis 3 because we will read this chapter again, from the start,
using other words and characters: this is the twin chapter of Genesis 32, and
our main character is Jacob.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Before
we fall deep into that rabbit hole, I would like to raise the banner of an
important anecdote I noticed through this work. My deep understanding of
Genesis 3 was, beyond doubt, the one that brought me to its twin, Genesis 32,
even though I did not have, four years ago when I read Genesis 3, the updated
tools I needed to read it with, since as I said I did not recognize the terms “
<em>Elohim</em>         ”
and “
<em>Jehova</em>         ” yet. The tools are but means to improve one’s view of the
text—but they may not aid in understanding it. In order to accurately
understand the text of the Torah, there is one universal tool that can be
applied to any Holy text, and that is 
<em>the will to know</em>         ; a true and
genuine wish to acquire knowledge.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Four
years ago, when I truly wanted to analyze Genesis 3, I did so and felt I
thoroughly understood its verses. When I wished to continue and progress in the
sphere of the Torah, I was able to identify new tools that improved my view of
the text, although they did not change the original pages. Utilizing these new
tools, i.e. the new terms, I was able to identify the twin chapter of Genesis
3—i.e. Genesis 32, the story of Jacob.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">It is
time to go back to the original text from Genesis 32, where Jacob’s struggle
against his conscious mind is described. Through this struggle and the events
to come, we will understand the second part of the name Israel—(Isra). But first
I want to briefly review the twin chapter, Genesis 3.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">I have
consumed dozens of pages to discuss and analyze Genesis 3, and I wish to
summarize them with a few words (but better not start counting). If we will go
back to the author of the Torah and the Seven Days of Creation with which he
opens his story, to ask 
<em>who is the author</em>          would be a mistake. But to ask
<em>what is the purpose of his essay</em>          is a legitimate question that can be
discussed, for every essay has content and a purpose that we may discuss, and
this essay is no different.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
essay concerns Man and is addressed to him and him alone. The formal purpose of
the author, as it seems from the content of his essay, is to regain Man his
Original Conscious Mind, wherever he may be. As time passed, Man lost touch
with his Original Conscious Mind and was nearly completely disconnected from
it.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
Conscious Mind is Man’s God; it is the center that drains all the information
collected by his senses and processed by his brain. The brain processes data received
by the senses and composes them into a decision. Eventually, one decides he
already knows what to do with the collected processed data and so he decides to
turn right. Another person, receiving the same processed data will reach the
decision to turn left. This is why the decision is attributed to the mind and
the data processing to the brain.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Who or
what is the mind, and where does it reside? No one can answer this question,
but there is no doubt that Man’s consciousness exists, for without the consciousness
there would be no “decision,” no existence to a Man that differs from the
beast—that also have a body and a brain, but does not have a conscious mind.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">From
this I can deduce the following axiom: the difference between the infamous
Einstein and Samuel is not the same as the difference between Einstein and a
beast. Both Samuel and Einstein have a brain, but their conscious minds are
different, and here lies the gap between them: Einstein knew what to do with
the processed data he had, while Samuel did not. Thus, the decisions Einstein
reached were different than that of Samuel.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">But this
axiom allegedly disregards the different IQ of individuals, which is de facto
responsible for the difference between Einstein and Samuel—and not their mind
or decision-making. This means that the brain one is born with is solely
responsible for the difference—between Samuel and Einstein as well as between
Einstein and the beast.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">But the
scripts from the Torah unequivocally point to the conscious mind, and not
intellect or IQ, as responsible for the difference between Samuel and Einstein.
The author of the Torah refers to this issue openly, right in the first verse
of Genesis (1:1):</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>In
the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</strong></p>                  
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
Human Consciousness (i.e. God) created the universe and Earth in it. In other
words, as soon as the Human Consciousness opened its eyes, it recognized Earth
and the universe around it; before that moment, the Consciousness had no data
at all then in a split second its mind was filled with the information of
heaven and Earth. It did not process any data previously obtained, which helped
it analyze and integrate the data of heaven and Earth. It simply received the
input, which was not there before, which is why the author uses the verb
“create,” which means to make something new that was not there before. The
Consciousness created (for itself) the data of heaven and Earth—it did not
produce them, make them, or carry them with it for later analysis.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">“Heaven
and Earth” are in fact that which 
<em>is</em>         . It is the universe, the complete
Original Picture. It is a single, whole day. It is the single, infinite
continuum of information, which the author will later discuss more thoroughly
as he expands the Original Picture. The property of the consecutive links of
information in the continuum is the one that attests to the “single”
parent-continuum, for without the consecutiveness we would have had several
chains of information. Since our consciousness receives reality from a single
chain only, we understand that while reality expands, it does not split.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">This is,
therefore, the unequivocal determination made by the author of the Torah, who
pointed to the consciousness as the sole entity responsible for the difference
between Samuel and Einstein, and not their intellectual difference.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>In
the beginning, “God” created the heaven and the earth.</strong></p>                  
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
consciousness created the continuum of information; it mentions neither Samuel
nor Einstein. In other words, regardless of the individual—be it Daniel, Samuel
or Einstein—they all “created” the same universe, absorbed the same continuum
in their minds. All the conscious minds started their journey from the same
place, launched away from it, and their paths began to separate only when they
began to actively slide down the continuum; this slide is a product of their
individual discretion, and while one may produce a great many things from the
continuum, another will have poor yield; one may turn right while the other
goes left; one may stop, for his own reasons, while the other rushes forward
with all haste. Each individual may accomplish according to his own decision.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">These
decisions of each conscious mind are the difference between Einstein and
Samuel, and they determine, among other things, an individual’s intellect as
well. Furthermore, they would also determine the individual’s height and skin
tone, hair and eye color, one’s mental, physical and immunological state, his
character and his looks. In other words, the decisions determine the
composition of an individual’s DNA, which is a giant molecule that contains the
entire hereditary information of an individual.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
question we asked—why was Einstein born with certain properties and Samuel with
others—is merely a technical query that the author of the Torah elaborates on
in the Sixth expansion. He shows us that which we could not see in the Original
Picture: that the Human Consciousness is a part of the parent single continuum
and thus it cannot be terminated. The Human Consciousness is composed of a
single link of information, just like any other link on the parent-continuum,
but unlike the other links this one is mobile and not motile</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">A chair,
a tree, the moon, the sun, a table—these are all proper links of information
from the continuum, but they are set in a fixed place and do not move from it
(unless they are actively moved by another entity). Unlike them, the link of
the conscious mind is not fixed but loose, as the author of the Torah describes
it:</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And
the spirit of God hovered over the face of the water.</strong></p>                  
<p style="direction: ltr;">I.e.
hovered over the continuum of information and “decides” where to just hover
over, land or even pull out of the chain—what links to harvest, how much should
be harvested, where should it harvest from, when will it harvest … these are
the mind’s decisions, and the trait of “decision-making” is given to it by its
property of mobilization. The mind is a single, mobile link of information of
the many links composing the infinite continuum, and due to this mobility, it
was granted the gift of decision-making. I steal a lot of information here from
the Sixth Expansion, but while I’m there, let me add a few more points to
complete the partial picture we already have.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">But
where does the body come from, and who made it? The answer is, again, the
conscious mind; the mind is the one harvesting the body from the continuum of
information. The body is a mobile vessel that fits the mind’s mobility property
and with it, the mind can roam free. It harvests the body from the continuum of
information in every sense of the word, and the vessel it harvested improves,
malfunctions, or simply goes extinct as time passes,—depending upon the mind’s
“decision.” The fate of the vessel depends on the quality of the mind’s
decisions, i.e.it depends on what use the mind has for this vessel.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
vessel, as mentioned above and like any other device, will perish if it is not
used correctly. It can last one year, a hundred twenty, a thousand years, or
even millions of years—the vessel can exist for eternity, depending upon the
consciousness’ decision, which this author will soon refer to as “soul.”</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Once the
vessel perishes, the mind simply harvests another vessel that will better
correspond to the point it has accomplished thus far; be it closer or farther,
smaller or larger, better or worse than before. The second vessel will
naturally preserve the accomplishments the conscious mind obtained with its
predecessor: height, length, color, IQ, character, health. The mind stores this
information in the DNA strands of the vessel and takes the second vessel once
again back to the road, picking up at the point where it previously stopped.
This cycle can repeat countless times, and each time, revealing a point from
which the mind can progress and develop or go back and withdraw from its
accomplishments, even those achieved by prior vessels, depending upon its
decision.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Note
that this is not reincarnation, as souls to not incarnate nor replenish—they
exist and continue to exist to infinity, hovering over the information.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">At this
point, we will return to Samuel and Einstein, adding Daniel and Yocheved. Each
of them “hovers” over the continuum of information at a different loci, each
has his or her vessel—the first has a good vessel, the second is worn, the
third has a wise vessel, while the forth is a fool.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
author of the Torah recognizes two main problems with these four people:
Einstein, Samuel, Daniel, and Yocheved. In fact, there are two main obstacles,
which prevent all four of them from moving forward on the continuum of
information. These obstacles stop the progress of the mind of each of the four,
prevent it from hovering freely over the continuum of information and enjoying
it.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">First
obstacle: all four people are unaware of the
essence of the conscious mind, and they recognize it as an integral part of
their physical body. None of them acknowledge the responsibility of their mind
to the place they arrived; where they currently stand. None of them identify
the connection between their mind and their body, i.e. the vessel which their
mind uses. Any reader of this paragraph may be one of these four persons, can
identify with them and understand their distress: I have no luck; I was born
poor; I have bad health; I was born ugly; he was born wise, she was born
beautiful, etc.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">We can
therefore define the first obstacle as a serious problem of lack of
information.Man has disconnected himself from his Original Conscious Mind and
has lost contact with it. He no longer recognizes the essence of his mind, its
role or field of responsibility. This is why he does not identify the cause of
his distress and blames an external entity, such as luck or poor DNA. Needless
to say that this obstacle inhibits one’s progress because one has no chance of
dealing with these allegedly “external” entities that dictate one’s agenda as
long as one does not acknowledge one’s conscience as the sole responsible
entity for the existence of these factors.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
first obstacle can be defined as a problem of lack of information, and this can
be treated by educating the addressee regarding this information, which is
exactly the task that the author of the Torah undertook: he will disclose full
information to his reader and complete the information the reader lacks.
Through his essay, the author of the Torah removes the obstacle of “lack of
knowledge.”</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">We now
return to our group of four and educate them with all their missing
information. Now they know how to identify the Original Conscious Mind, its
role, path, field of responsibility and can even identify the vessel each has
taken (i.e. his body) and its position. Yet, despite this complete knowledge,
the second obstacle suddenly emerges and erupts in their faces like a spitting
volcano.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Second
obstacle: they remain in their distress! I can
still hear them clearly, the four people who already received the complete
information about their Original Conscious Mind, keep complaining. I have no
luck; death is around the corner; I was born miserable; I was born with poor
health; I do not know what tomorrow brings; he was born beautiful while I was
born ugly; he was born smart, or strong; I’m afraid, hesitant, the uncertainty
is killing me, doubt makes me restless. …</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">I do not
understand those people. They already know they reached their beauty or
ugliness, their bad health or misery and even color of their eyes—all due to
the discrete decision of their conscious mind. They know that their current
state is the result of the sum of their mind’s decisions. They know that their
mind shaped their updated DNA strands. They know that their mind hovers over
the continuum of information make of consecutive links, and that their mind
controls this continuum, which is why there is no reason for this doubt or
hesitation or uncertainty they are experiencing, and the place where they stand
and/or will stand depends solely on the decisions their mind will make. At its
will, they will be on top or sink below, and if that is the case, why do they
suddenly express statements that renounce the responsibility of their mind?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
author of the Torah inspects these four persons and identifies the source of
disruption in their behavior. None of them accepts the infinite continuum of
information. Indeed, they reject it! They insist on objecting to it! Luck still
controls information, we do not know what tomorrow may bring and doubt
overcomes certainty.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">The gap
between the decisions of the brain and those of the mind causes the disruption
in their behavior.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Most
human decisions do not even reach the conscious mind, and are accepted directly
through the human brain. This includes eating, sleeping, lying down, walking,
blowing one’s nose, taking a shower, going to sleep, waking up in the morning,
going to work and coming back in the evening.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
conscious mind, however, can intervene with human decisions from time to time,
as it takes control and makes decisions—usually against the brain’s judgment
and satisfaction. This is because of the size of the raw field of information
at the disposal of these two data processors: the brain and the mind.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
information of the entire universe is divided into two: the information known
to Man and that which is unknown. The known information is the knowledge we
mastered and can use, and it is accessible to our brain which uses and
processes it. The sky is the limit for this level of information, but that is
not a metaphor: any information our eyes and ears and hands can sense and
obtain about the Earth, the stars and the galaxies is within it, but still
there is information beyond that – information we cannot reach, not using our
senses, and that is the information that stands beyond the limiting “sky”,
metaphysical information which uncharted territories merely begin where the
“sky” ends.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
human brain is, without doubt, capable of enormous capacities and surely, the
raw field of information at its disposal provides all the data it requires for
its capabilities. Nevertheless, the human brain is still limited because its
field of information is finite.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">However,
the field of information that is available to the mind is infinite, and spans
across sum of all information: the information of reality, and the information
about that which is beyond heaven and the longing created for it. The conscious
mind is mobile and free, hovers over the infinite continuum of information
without a single boundary that may limit its access to areas it wishes to
reach. In other words, when the mind wishes to make a decision and process the
data it possesses, the continuum of information at its disposal is far greater
and longer than the chain of information at the disposal of the brain.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">There is
a significant difference between the two fields: the field of information at
the disposal of the brain contains processed data, yet the information
available to the mind is raw and wild. This is why the mind normally relies on
the brain’s decision and does not interfere with them, for they were made based
on processed information that could withstand the outcome criteria.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Nevertheless,
as I said, sometimes the mind still takes the reins and makes a decision,
despite the brain’s decision. What is its decision based on, in these cases?
The mind’s decision uses the advantage it has over the brain: the sequence of
links in an infinite continuum of information, which it hovers over and it, and
not the brain, can access. It uses the quality of 
<strong>sequence</strong>          of the
endless chain of links available to it.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">It leans
on the sequence property and can see the direction of the links before it. If
it will go in a certain direction, it will reach its desired destination,
because the sequence of links clearly highlights its desired path. This is why
a person who reaches decisions of 
<em>this</em>          type cannot explain why he acted
in a way that is sometimes against logic, for he in fact has no processed data
except for the property of sequence. On the other hand, a person who makes a
decision using his brain may be called a realist and his decision will be
considered logical, matching reality, a substantial decision that uses
processed data.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">We now
return to our four odd people and the gap between the decisions of the brains 
<em>vs.</em>         
their minds, which causes disruption in their behavior. They returned to their
Original Conscious Mind and acknowledged the infinite continuum of information,
realized that they can move along it forever and reach its every part, harvest
and enjoying its products, and live for eternity. However, their brain still
insists on stopping any “unfounded” decision that their conscience makes and
waves the processed data it possesses in its “face.”</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
brain, we may claim, has a basic objection to the continuum property of the
chain of information, the property which the conscious mind leans on in order
to direct its movement. For the brain has a limited chain of information that
it may take data from and process, so all the other data which are not in its
sphere and at its reach are the unknown which must be controlled by fate,
surely, and directed by luck. The brain cannot believe that a spatial sequence
of these other data outside its reach can exist, because the property of
sequence attests to complete certainty, and the brain cannot perceive certainty
in the unknown sphere, nor can it accept a consecutive connection between the
sphere of uncertainty and the sphere of reality. This is the source of the
brain’s doubts and fear.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The gap
between the decisions of the brain and those of the mind caused the disruption
in the behavior of our four people. The conscious mind crosses the sphere of
reality while the brain stops it; the mind usually agrees with the brain’s
decisions, but sometimes it makes a decision against the brain’s will.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">This is
the essence of the second obstacle that stops the progress of the Original
Conscious Mind, preventing it from hovering over the continuum of information
and enjoying it. The only thing that can withstand this obstacle and overcome
it is the “decision of the mind.”</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">If you
remember, the first obstacle that stopped the progress of the mind was “lack of
information.” Man lost contact with his Original Conscious Mind and so he could
not recognize the essence of the mind, its role and field of responsibility in
his life. This problem was taken care of by the author of the Torah in a
perfect and professional manner. The author brought Man a complete picture of
the Original Conscious Mind and laid it before him in the first chapter of
Genesis, using the Seven Expansions of the Original Picture, an array by which
even a simpleton will be able to intake the complete picture and all its
details.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">In
practice, the author addressed the human brain in the first chapter and
provides it with the missing information, i.e. receivable information that will
provide the brain’s pool of information with basic information about the
complete picture and its principle: the conscious mind can control the complete
chain of information despite its endlessness—because of its property of
sequence. By doing so, the author of the Torah completes his treatment of the
first obstacle and finishes his entire quota of treatment, because he puts all
the missing information on the table and the rest is up to the human mind and
its decision. Whether it will slide through space depends solely on it’s the
mind’s decision. Whether it will accept the decisions of its brain or reject
them and slide onward, is up to the mind.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Here,
however, comes the second obstacle, which the author cannot even try to treat,
for the only thing that can remove this obstacle and object to it is the mind.
Only the mind can decide to reject the realist decisions of the brain if it
sees fit, and this is Man’s individual and personal business.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">But the
author of the Torah is dedicated and still refuses to give up, and found a
creative route to stream information through and assist Man, who stood confused
before his brain, having difficulty making the decision—whether to slide along
the infinite sphere weaved with consecutive links or oblige the tough,
realistic voices of his brain.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Man
faces a heavy dilemma. We can explain it with the following simple equation: a
realistic man who always followed the decisions of his brain will live a
dignified life for many years and die with dignity; but his demise is certain,
for at the end of the day he will crumble and die. On the other hand, the man
who lets his mind soar free and unlimited may enjoy the fruits of the infinite
continuum of information; he will be able to live forever if he will be wise
enough the identify the property of sequence in his mind, and recruit it as a
compass to lead his way. The dilemma is, doubtless, a most difficult one.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Thus,
the author of the Torah decided to help this confused Man who is torn by
dilemma between his mind and his brain. The author decides to tell Man the
entire story of the conscious mind and the brain, as spanned over the entire
human history. In this history, we will encounter all the possible situations
Man can come across in his confusion, when his mind and brain are struggling in
the arena. That history speaks with characters that knew the Original Picture
from one of its six Expansions, and are aware of the existence of the Original
Conscious Mind and its role in space.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Using
this route, the author hoped that Man will look at his dilemma from one of the
presented pictures and decide whether he should draw the right conclusions from
them.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Now we
finally reach the First Picture, which represents the first struggle Man faces,
when his mind encounters his brain. This picture is depicted in Genesis 3, also
known as the chapter about the “Sin of the First Man.” In this chapter is the
basic picture of the essential dilemma that every person encounters, because
his mind and brain speak in different tongues. Who should have the final vote?
Or, more accurately, who should be given the right to decide—the brain or the
mind? Which of these two entities can say “I know”?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
scales favor the brain, and the verdict is determined before the trial begins.
The realistic brain will be the one to determine the opinion, and because of
this verdict,Man (Son of Eve) developed an official reconciliation with his
doubts, fears, luck and their derivatives. All this, because the brain
determined that the information we have and can control is definitely partial,
while the information that remains in the universe—which is the lion’s
share—cannot be controlled by us, is unknown to us, and therefore the human brain
officially comes to terms with the doubts, the concerns, and the fear of the
unknown. Since the unknown surpasses that which is known, doubt will always
surpass certainty.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">Thus the
human brain raises the banner of its sense of helplessness, derived from doubt
and the likes, and give it an official seal of approval: Man’s sense of
helplessness is normal from now on and is derived from reality. From that
moment, this sense has its own voice and place in the human consciousness, and
it speaks up in every argument.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
author of the Torah gives this sense the codename “Serpent”: the Hebrew word, 
<em>Nachash</em>         ,
has the same root as the verb 
<em>Lenachesh</em>         , which means to guess, assume,
speculate, etc. For Man is at a complete atmosphere of uncertainty and can do
nothing but guess, speculate, and live with his doubts.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Moreover,
and under the same cloudy mood of the sphere of uncertainty, there is also the
need to survive and to neutralize all the threats in one’s surroundings. To
survive also means to threaten—unless you want to be threatened. Thus the
phrase “the end justifies the means” was born, as well as the moral
justification for “better abuse than be abused,” “be the cheater and not
cheated,” “be the thief and not the victim,” etc. One must learn how to live
amongst lions and still get by in life, to prey on life. Thus the idea of the
conniving, venomous serpent, that crawls in the high grass, preying on its food
with its deadly bite, was consolidated in Man’s conscience. The traits of the
serpent became a need, and it made a home in Man’s soul, its voice heard in
every substantial argument, much like the basic argument between the conscious
mind and the brain.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">And so
we are joined by a new member of this forum, discussing the basic difference
between the brain and the mind, sitting along with them: all welcome the new
participant, the Serpent!</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">To
thoroughly analyze this discussion we must first identify the active entities
joined by it. For now, we have identified the Serpent—the new member that
invaded the discussion. For now, though, I would like to excuse him out of the
forum and go back a while, to before the Serpent was even born, when the
Original Conscious Mind existed in full in Man’s soul, or in this case—Woman’s
soul.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Deep
within Eve’s Original Conscious Mind and prior to this argument, several terms
were defined in her mind. We already discussed them when we inspected the
difference between the decisions of the brain and those of the mind. The
brain’s field of information is limited but contains processed data, which is
why its decisions are realistic, justified yet limited. However, the conscious
mind hovers over an infinite field of information—which is limitless but
composed of unprocessed data. Nevertheless, the continuum, which controls these
unprocessed data, marks the direction of the tracks to the mind, and the mind
uses the property of sequence to identify the direction of its progress. In the
lack of processed data in its field, the mind exploits the continuum for all
its decisions. This is why the mind’s decisions are focused on the aspect of
direction but do not investigate every little detail, thus the decisions of the
mind are often shot through the path of “principle,” which is directly fed by
the sequence of links of information that direct towards it.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">But what
happens to the conscious mind that it resigns from its official role: to
identify the trait of the sequence in the infinite continuum of information?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
answer is harsh and to the point: this mind will be put out of any action, and
hover over the continuum of information with no direction. Its trait of
mobility will fade away, along with the vessel it is currently employing.
Simultaneously, the property of slothfulness will control the mind and force it
to depend on the brain, feed on its activity, which is relatively limited due
to its limited field of information—and this will make the brain gradually fade
away as well, for it will have fewer and fewer data to identify. Eventually the
mind will have to part from its vessel and return, disgraced and “naked as the
day it was created,” to its starting point with nearly nothing to show for
itself. During this time of inactivity, it will lose most of its assets and
will have nothing to rely on when starting its next round.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">In other
words, the mind that resigns from its duty is crashing, or in simple
terms—dying. This is a destiny known to all the stakeholders in the above
discussion, i.e. both the brain and mind of the woman, until the Serpent comes,
resides in the woman, and participates in the discussion. The Serpent is taking
over the brain and speaks on its behalf—i.e. in the name of reality. Its role
in this debate is to eliminate Eve’s remnants of the Original Conscious Mind,
which was already practically gone. In simple terms, the Serpent verified the
slaughter to ensure that there is no means for the conscious mind to express
itself and its delusions. 
<em>We live in</em>          
<em>this reality, and there is
nothing beyond this reality</em>         , the Serpent chants as its motto.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">When the
Bible says “
<strong>and [the Serpent] said unto the woman</strong>         ”, it actually means
the Serpent was speaking to what remnants of the Original Conscious Mind the
woman had left. Eve’s Original Conscious Mind nearly perished, and the Serpent
within it bears a strong testimony of this decay, so the discussion that is
about to unfold between the Serpent and Eve’s mind is nothing but a fake
debate, as if Eve’s mind is still struggling against her brain and can conduct
a serious discussion to the point. In a more up-to-date analogy, it looks like
Donald Trump talking to a sworn Republican and trying to convince him to vote
for the Elephant. The Serpent, speaking on behalf of the brain with Eve’s
conscious mind, was doing nothing but convincing the convinced.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">Eve’s
mind has already forgotten the property of the continuum and everything derived
from it, and has nothing but segmented memories of a time before it began to
decay, when it could still see the line that separates the limited chain of
information represented by its brain from the infinite continuum with its
sprouting links of information. A time when it would hover over the links and
extract the properties of the continuum from them—and lo, what a sweet, and
useful and enjoyable property that was— But now her mind remembers nothing of
that joy, except for a dim sensation of eternal peace. Its remaining memories
contain the sensation of fear from the depths it began to fall into when it
succumbed to the brain, when it resigned from its duty and abandoned all behind
it. It memorized the moments of decay, of crashing, of death; and these
memories direct its current discussion with the brain, controlled by the
Serpent: what brings a man to die, is it knowledge or ignorance?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
Serpent replied without hesitation, “ignorance!”</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">But the
shreds of Eve’s Original Conscious Mind say, “I remember something… vaguely…
that it is actually knowledge that leads to death. I cannot point to my
resources because my memories are awry, but if I remember anything I remember
this: knowledge brings death, at the end of the day; knowledge leads to that
dark and frightening pit.”</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">I wish
to pause this description of the discussion and add a personal comment. Eve
remembers full well that indeed “knowledge” will eventually lead to its demise.
Eve remembers scattered moments of a discussion her mind conducted a long time
ago with its brain, when her Original Conscious Mind was at its prime.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Back
then, her brain insisted “the right to decide is mine, and not yours—you weird
consciousness. I am the one who represents reality, realism, and
substantiality. I represents knowledge, and based on this knowledge I make my
decisions. I process the realistic, substantial data and produce a real
decision that will represent reality and comply with it. You, the mind, do not
process anything. You haven’t a single process data to rely on; your decisions
are random and spontaneous. I have no knowledge of any other chain of
information, but the realistic chain that represents all that we know, and
everything else is the unknown. And how will a weirdo such as yourself identify
the sequence of continuum in the unknown?”</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
Original Conscious Mind replies to that, “I direct you to one of the six
Original Pictures that were meant for you, where you will clearly see the two
parts of the chain—the realistic one which is ours, and the one above it—which
you call ‘the unknown’. In this Original Picture, you can study the property of
the links’ consecutiveness in both parts of the chain. This property controls
the two parts and connects them. This is the source of my decisions, which rely
on the property of the sequence, which stretches all the way to reality and
connects it with the unknown.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">“Thus,
dear brain,” the Conscious Mind continued, “You must realize your limitations
and the defined field which you feed upon. You feed on reality, a partial chain
of information that while it is growing will forever be partial, limited, and
never represent the full picture. This is why your decisions, which you base on
this chain, are necessarily limited and limiting. The understanding of the full
picture is the only means that will allow you to connect with the other segment
of information, through the property of the sequence that controls the
continuum of information; this is the trait that will liberate your decisions
of their limitations.”</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">This is
how the Original Conscious Mind summarizes its arguments to the brain. “If you
insist on maintaining your vanity and waive the full picture and the trait of
sequence that characterizes it, you should know that the information you hold
will be your downfall and will limit you in two ways:</p>         
<p class="ListParagraph1" style="direction: ltr;">a.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; “The information will attract you to the
limited chain of which you feed your reality and imprints you with the trait of
disability until you will accept your limited reality, which has a beginning
and must also have an end. This is, in my opinion, the greatest limitation of
all—death.</p>          
<p class="ListParagraph1" style="direction: ltr;">b.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; “Your realistic perception of the limited
information you feed on will necessarily create a distortion of the essence of
acquiring information in your eyes, the entire concept of ‘knowledge’ will be
twisted in your mind, because you will recognize reality as the only pipe from
which one can extract information; knowledge. This way, your mind will be
disconnected from the other part of information, the one that connects your
reality with infinity, because your realistic perception will deny the quality
of continuity that connects the two parts of information.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">“And
so,” the Original Conscious Mind implores the brain, “Please do not eat the
forbidden fruit, dear brain. Do not eat the fruit of delusion, which will lead
to your limitation and eventually your demise. Remember this and do not forget:
that which will, eventually, bring your disability is not the information but
rather the knowledge that will be distorted in your mind.”</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">This
ends the principal debate between Eve’s Original Conscious Mind and her
realistic brain. Later, Eve’s mind will decide, due to its laziness, to dismiss
itself and lose its mobility until it will fully succumb to the brain and rely
on it. Then, it will gradually fade and decay, and the mind’s decisions will no
longer have any significance or importance. During this time, the royal first
couple will have their legal son and they shall name him “Serpent.”</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
debate that the author of the Torah unravels in Genesis 3 was conducted after
Eve succumbed to her realistic brain, and her Original Conscious Mind was no
more than shattered memories that the woman could not reconnect. This is the
source of the distortion in the question that was discussed between the
Serpent—the official spokesperson of her brain—and her conscious mind.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Originally,
the question was, “Who shall have the deciding vote? Who will have the final
opinion, the brain or the mind? Which one can say ‘I know!’ and it will be accepted,
the brain or the mind?”</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">After
Eve succumbed to her realistic brain, and after her mind resigned from its role
of identifing the continuum of information, disconnecting from the infinite
sphere, it applies instead the defined sphere of reality on itself, for all of
reality’s rules and limitations that will predict the mind’s own death and
demise. After this quick transition, her mind suddenly remembers the moments of
disconnection, the stress, the feeling of limitation and of death. These
shatters are mixed with more crumbs of information and knowledge, as defined in
her previous discussion with the Serpent.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">From
this mix of shattered memories, Eve sets the background to “the weirdo”
discussion with her brain, after it was possessed by the Serpent: what brings
Man’s demise—is it knowledge or ignorance?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">“Ignorance!”
said the Serpent decisively, and rightfully. But Eve remembers something of her
past, something dim, barely there, that tells her that it is knowledge that
causes death. The sources are mixed up but she remembers the warning well:
knowledge eventually brings death, and not ignorance. Knowledge is why she felt
that frightening pit once. She remembers 
<em>that</em>          stress full well.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
Serpent warns Eve not to distance herself from reality. Knowledge was never the
cause of death! On the contrary, ignorance brings one closer to death since
knowledge gives one the opportunity to defuse threats and threaten the
assailant; knowledge allows one to survive, live, and prosper. Once again, the
Serpent is right and every word is true.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
basis of the Serpent’s words is true and Eve listens to him with great
attention, and soon her mind aligns with her brain and is convinced by its
valued position: one must follow reality and tell right from wrong, otherwise one
will lose direction. Knowledge should be recruited to the battle of survival,
or else we will find ourselves in an early grave. And every word of this is
true.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">As I
said, this is the essence of the fake debate in which the brain convinces the
convinced, and everyone lives happily ever after. This is the essence of the
human debate of every man or woman with “shreds of consciousness” that does not
know what to do with those small shredded pieces. Most people sit their minds
and brains at the table, starting a thorough and harsh debate, at the end of
which they reach a single conclusive decision: one must follow reality and its
definite rules. This finally eliminates the odd effect by the shreds of
consciousness, which is leeching the DNA and labors the brain’s regular
activity. I do not know if there is any remnant of the Original Conscious Mind
in our age, but I believe we can still sense its spirit whenever we test our
principles against the data of reality.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Unlike
us, however, some generations surely were aware of the essence of the Original
Conscious Mind, even if only in theory; they could read the original form of
the Torah and learn about the Original Picture from Genesis 1. Such were the
Hebrew nomads in their journey across the desert, and every other generation
from the period of the Torah—including that of Eve, of course.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">In other
words, even after the fake debate between Eve’s mind (through its official
spokesperson, the Serpent) and in spite of it, the Original Conscious Mind, at
least as a theoretical concept, had a place in Eve’s reality. Even during this
made-up discussion, the Original Conscious Mind had a seat, it was involved in
the debate and its theoretical “voice” was heard—but fell on deaf ears.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Now is
the time to return to Jacob and the struggle of 
<em>his</em>          consciousness with
his realistic side—i.e. his realistic brain. Through documenting this struggle
and its consequences we will understand the second part of the name Israel—
<em>Isra</em>         ,
the meaning of which is derived from the Hebrew verb to rule, to fight for
one’s dominance or reign over another; to dominate the control over God—that
which stands at the head of the pyramid, i.e. the self-consciousness.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">When we
reviewed Genesis 3, I wished to relay before you some basic terms that will
illuminate the basic struggle between a man and his mind. Simultaneously I
tried to expose the existential contradiction between the realistic brain and
the conscious mind, the original role of which was to wander space and identify
it through the trait of continuity, which dominates the continuum of
information, as well as to connect reality with the sphere through the same
trait.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">While I
said earlier that I will summarize my analysis of Genesis 3 with just a few
words, I also said you should not count my every written note. At least I stood
by 
<em>that</em>          declaration.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">To
return to Jacob and his documented struggle in Genesis 32:</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong><sup>25</sup></strong>         &#160;And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a
man with him until the breaking of the day.&#160;
<strong><sup>26</sup></strong>         &#160;And when he saw that he prevailed not
against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's
thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.&#160;
<strong><sup>27</sup></strong>         &#160;And he said: 'Let me go, for the day
breaketh.' And he said: 'I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.'&#160;
<strong><sup>28</sup></strong>         &#160;And he said unto him: 'What is thy
name?' And he said: 'Jacob.'&#160;
<strong><sup>29</sup></strong>         &#160;And he said: 'Thy name shall be called
no more Jacob, but Israel; for thou hast striven with God and with men, and
hast prevailed.'
<strong><sup>30</sup></strong>         &#160;And
Jacob asked him, and said: 'Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.' And he said: 'Wherefore
is it that thou dost ask after my name?' And he blessed him there.&#160;
<strong><sup>31</sup></strong>         &#160;And Jacob called the name of the place
Peniel: 'for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.'&#160;
<strong><sup>32</sup></strong>         &#160;And the sun rose upon him as he passed
over Peniel, and he limped upon his thigh.&#160;
<strong><sup>33</sup></strong>         &#160;Therefore the children of Israel eat
not the sinew of the thigh-vein which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto
this day; because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh, even in the sinew of
the thigh-vein.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">These
verses are the end of Genesis 32, but we should probably analyze things from
the beginning of the chapter—where the author of the Torah describes the
background that consequentially leads to the struggle. This background gives
room to the school Jacob leaned towards since his youth, as we saw in the
incident of the pottage. But if we start talking about the beginning, the first
verses will never be enough, and going further back will only make us tired and
lose focus (as happened with the “summary” of Genesis 3, which we did not even
start discussing as thoroughly as we could).</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Our
purpose is to define the term “
<strong>Israel,</strong>         ” the man who struggled to
dominate his consciousness. We previously analyzed the characteristics of the 
<em>El</em>         
part of Jacob’s name and discovered which school he was part of. Now we have
the first part of the term: the struggle of his conscious mind with his
realistic side—his brain.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him
until the breaking of the day.</strong>          This verse should be
analyzed from the end to the beginning in order to fully understand it. First,
the event happens at the “breaking of the day”; but when does one finds himself
active at this time, what was he doing all through the night in the meanwhile?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">In the
previous four pictures, we analyzed two terms, Evening and Morning. Together
they compose the entire day. The full picture we were exposed to over the four
expansions completely transcends over both, as it begins in the evening,
continues through morning and finally reaches climax at noon. This creates a
cycle of 24 hours, one day.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">This is
the one day cycle of the Original Conscious Mind; the original picture,
complete with all the information received by the Original Mind. The
information is the universe, it is everything around us—matter, moon, galaxies,
a table—and you never forget any of it: not the chair, not the people around
you, all there is, all the matter, all that is known and that which is unknown.
</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
known information is the sphere of reality—all the information that was already
received and processed by us. This is the reason an individual’s sphere of
reality is different from that of his friend, because even if both individuals
occupy the same space on Earth they each process data differently. I already
know what atoms, electrons, and galaxies are, do you? I can identify a chair at
the level of the atoms and electrons it is composed of. Perhaps you will only
see the chair for its macro shape; and a newly born infant will not even be
able to do that. This is why my reality is bigger than your, and yours is
bigger than the infant’s—and even the infant’s small reality, received by his
humongous consciousness in such a short period of time, is composed of billions
of links of information.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Other
than the known information, or reality’s information, there is definitely more
data that we still did not reach or did not process. This unknown information
can be right under our noses and we just did not recognize it, like a table,
that one does not understand is also made of atoms, electrons, and protons. The
unknown information can also be beyond our visible field, like information
about the moon, the stars, and the galaxies.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Thus,
the level of knowledge we have about the matter we can see, or that which is
beyond our vision, can still be divided into two: the known information—which
is within our level of information, and the unknown, which is beyond us. In
this manner, even the information of the components of the table must have an
unknown part, outside our field of information. This means that an individual’s
reality reflects that individual’s “level of knowledge” about the information
projected from matter, forming the moon, the chair, the galaxies and the table—matter
that never forgets its data.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
conclusion is that even the close sphere of an individual’s reality is composed
of known and unknown information, and of course the unknown part of the sphere
of reality adds to the unknown part of spheres external to the individual
sphere—the sphere of complete information; the sphere of the universe.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">There are, therefore, two large parts of
information:</p>         
<p class="ListParagraph1" style="direction: ltr;">1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The information of reality (everything one
knows thus far);</p>          
<p class="ListParagraph1" style="direction: ltr;">2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The information beyond reality (the rest of the
information in the entire universe).</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Man of
both modern and ancient times stood helpless before the information of the
second type, which was beyond one’s reality, and was afraid of it because he
had no control over it. The fear of the unknown is deeply imprinted on us, but
on the contrary, our source of confidence is that which is known, the
information that was already identified by us and is under our complete
control.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Note
that the information man fears and is beyond his reality also includes the
information in the sphere of reality which man did not recognize yet, and of course
the information which is far from his sphere of reality, such as information
about the galaxies, which man’s knowledge of them is only now beginning to
unravel.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">But man
is not really concerned about the information beyond his sphere; he does not fear
not controlling that information, because the influence of the information on
him, if and when it will be obtained, will be as far as the nearest galaxy (for
better or for worse).</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The true
concern man has, comes from the partial information that is within his sphere
of reality but he cannot control, for it was not yet recognized by him. This
lack of control over information that will have direct influence on one’s life
is what creates our sense of helplessness and from which our concerns, fear,
doubts, and insecurities derive. This is man’s one true limitation, that he
tried to face from the dawn of humanity, and all we know about this limitation
is that it is 
<strong>the lack of knowledge about the unknown</strong>         .</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">One day
we obtained a book from an author who wished not to be identified, for whatever
personal reasons. And this book presented an alternative theory regarding the
essence of human limitation. He left us that book and left us with the decision
of whether or not we will put his theory to the test, turn it into a dogma, or
leave it as a theory forever. We decided to leave the book as a theory but
named it 
<em>Torah</em>          (which is Hebrew for dogma)—an odd decision on its own,
which only emphasizes the embarrassed and confused facet of humanity.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">At this
point we turn to the biblical term “
<em>Donkey</em>         ” that will connect us with
the theory of the book, but as I already discussed the term in the Fourth
Expansion [cf. the Fourth chapter of “The Seven Days of Creation” series] I
believe we can skip it for now and go directly to the theory the author
suggested in his book.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
theory claims that the limitation of the human race is not the 
<strong>lack of
knowledge of the unknown</strong>         , but rather 
<strong>lack of knowledge of the full
picture of Man’s Original Conscious Mind</strong>         . Should we be able to reevaluate
the full picture and adopt it, if we were to regain our Original Conscious
Mind, then we could eliminate our human limitation forever. 
</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">I have
examined this theory and concluded that its meaning is life eternal, in every
sense of the word, because as far as I know, death is one of the human
limitations Man suffers from. This conclusion made me curious, and perhaps even
hopeful, and I wanted to test this theory as it was stated.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The full
picture of the Original Conscious Mind was presented by the author of the Torah
through six expansions, so that anyone reading the Torah will eventually be
able to identify the full picture using one of the six expansions. The Seventh
Expansion is common to all the expansions, because it summarizes every note and
pixel of the Original Picture. This is why the author leaves it until the end,
as a stand-alone unit that represents all the expansions together and
individually. We will analyze it further later on.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
truth is that it wasn’t until the Fifth Expansion that I started to feel a
personal connection to the theory and the Original Picture. I did not manage to
feel connected to any of the prior four expansions, and only saw dried
theoretical data in them. Today, however, I understand why the author chose to
create seven expansions.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">The full
picture of the theory, suggested in the book, also marks two main segments in
the pile of information. These segments are the same as the ones identified by
Man in his time:</p>         
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="direction: ltr;">1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The
realistic information, i.e. all the information Man identified so far and has
deposited in his brain.</p>          
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="direction: ltr;">2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The
information from the other side of reality, i.e. all the unknown information
that was not yet recognized by an individual. This is the remainder of the
information in the universe.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">We
therefore must internalize the theory and then we can live forever—piece of
cake, as they say.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">This is
the primary meaning of the theory: 
<strong>all the links of information in the
universe are organized into a single, continuous chain of information</strong>         .</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">This
theory is both good and bad news.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">The good
news is that the theory isn’t new to anyone. Our conscious mind has recognized
the trait of continuity in the information since the dawn of time, and it even
uses this trait regularly. The author of the theory is not teaching anyone anything
new here, and our own principles are originally based on this theory. Many
people willingly sacrificed themselves for their land and died for their
country, and if they had had any doubt in the truthfulness of this theory they
would not have walked into that battlefield in the first place.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The bad
news is that the human brain rejects this theory for as long as the mind is
aware of it, because it negates the brain’s essence: the brain is a machine for
the processing and storing of information, and so only processed or to-be
processed information has any reason to exist. The theory, however, claims that
unknown information that is beyond grasped reality is also continuous; it is
like arguing about whether the non-existent apple is red or green, because the
unknown information does not exist to begin with, as far as the brain considers
it.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The mind
must therefore fill this missing place for the brain, tell it that the apple
does exist and that the mind has seen it and its color. For this theory, the mind
reassures the brain that it knows the trait of continuity and it must attract
the brain to identify this trait as well, in order for the brain to be able to
recognize the existence of unknown information dominated by the trait of
continuity. This is the only way for the brain to recognize the unknown
information, because the mind helps the brain clearly identify one variable of
the formula and acknowledge the other; it recognizes the trait of continuity of
the links—which means that the links must exist.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
Original Conscious Mind attracts the brain to identify the trait of continuity,
and the mechanical brain naturally objects to this road trip the mind forces it
into; this is the essence of the conflict between the brain and the conscious
mind.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">We will
now discuss the struggle that arose between Jacob’s conscious mind and brain
and refer to them as two “entities,” but in fact this is a single entity named
Man—it is Jacob whose brain and mind are one. This bipolar separation between
the brain and the mind is a method, the copyrights of which were claimed by the
author of the Torah, who used it in order to investigate the depths of human
thought and describe his findings from the deepest pits.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">And so,
it is only when the brain goes hand in hand with the mind and discovers the
trait of continuity, that he also identifies the two parts of the
information—one, the rapidly growing reality, and the other, the area, which is
the source of reality’s information. The brain will be able to point to the
bond it created to this area. It did so when it “reached into the stack of
information and took a handful of what it considered as the firstborn,” which
was its guiding light [The two terms, “firstborn” and “guiding light” (
<em>Bechor</em>         
and 
<em>Ma’or</em>          respectively) are discussed thoroughly in Chapter Four: “On
the Fourth Day.”]. But now it can also recognize the “stars” and “every
firstling of an ass (more terms from the Fourth Day),” which participated in
this huge project even though they were not invited. This way, Man will utilize
his brain and his mind as one—gaining full and undisputed control of the entire
stack of information, and 
<em>that</em>          is the full picture of the Original
Conscious Mind of Man, which spreads over an entire day.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">And
there was evening, and there was morning, one day. In the evening Man prepares
for the long night, and by morning he buckles down to work, and actively
harvest the fruits of the day.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">In other
words, the night contains all the unknown information, the darkness that Man
did not discover yet. In the evening, Man prepares to go to bed and sleep on
this information, contemplate it, plan how to reap it tomorrow, how to control
it, to create a bond with it. He thinks in general terms, isolated, sinking
deep within himself. His mind and brain begin their bargain, and it is in these
moments that the mind tries to take the brain for a walk down continuum-lane.
Here lies the true struggle between the main players—the mind and the brain.
This true struggle can go on from dusk till dawn, until Man wakes for another
day of labor, and other entities join the arena. The isolation is disrupted.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And Jacob was left alone; and there
wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.</strong>          We now witness a rare masterpiece, depicted by the hand of an
artist. This artist painted the struggle that arose within Jacob between his
brain and his mind, depicted as two personas that struggle mercilessly and
without compromise. So well the picture was constructed, you could not guess
their true identity.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
first persona is Jacob, the innocent man we encountered in the tale of the
pottage; he belonged to the first school since his youth, and identified the
trait of continuity since the beginning. This is why he harvested the continuum
for his living, and did not have to devour it, because the links of information
are there and will always be there, and all he had to do was reach out and grab
them, taking them at his own leisure. This is the man who sat in a tent and
harvested life peacefully, with no haste or hurry. He had no need to charge on
life and rip them from the field—the exact opposite of his twin brother.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">In this
man there is a struggle, a struggle forced upon him by reality. Esau’s school
was taking root and no one could ignore it; our generation knows this school all
too well, the system that preaches to reality and denies the unrealistic. This
school is hard to argue with, for it is the fruit of logic. It was adopted by
the brain, which used it to push away the continuum that the mind confronted it
with. But this school cannot point to the links of the continuum—because it
cannot see them. 
<em>What links do you speak of, dear conscious mind, and what
logic do you use?</em></p>                  
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
conscious mind cannot reply—perhaps because laziness took it over and the brain
finally won, or perhaps the brain imprisoned it behind walls, forcing the mind
to rely on the brain so much until it faded away and left on its own.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Jacob’s
brain is also exposed to reality. It has been working extra hard, confronting a
worthy opponent. Jacob’s mind does not give up easy: the struggle is harsh and
even brutal, every party fighting for its right to exist, each knowing that it
must not compromise in this battle—it’s life or death, and the loser will be
gone from existence at the end.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">While
the struggle occurs within Jacob, the author of the Torah, the artist that he
is, split it in two and depicted it as the struggle of another man; a stranger
who uses Jacob as a battle field. Jacob was reluctant in lending this arena,
but the stranger forced himself on Jacob, entered and started this miserable
war; he has chosen Jacob as his arena.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">Jacob
observes this from the side, bothered only by the occurrence of the battle but
not by its content. He even tries to take sides—but again, not in the content.
Meaning Jacob does not try to help the brain or the mind, but he fights the
intruder who forced this struggle onto him, trying to subdue him, remove him,
to explicitly say: sir, this is not my fight, I have no interest in it because
I am a man who dwells in tents, who harvests life peacefully.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Did I
not say he was an artist? And you will soon agree with me, I assure you. Let us
review these words again, for now you finally have the tools to understand
them.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And Jacob was left alone; and there
wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.</strong>          I have said all I can and there is nothing left to add to your
understanding or to further enrich this verse.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And when he saw that he prevailed not
against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's
thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.</strong></p>                  
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And when he saw that he prevailed not
against him …</strong></p>                   
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
invader realized he could not defeat Jacob, that Jacob, trying with all his
might to remove him, was burdening him—and Jacob on his end feels, as I said,
that this battle was forced upon him. He does all he can to burden the intruder
and remove him from within himself.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>He touched the hollow of his thigh.</strong>          Man has a hand. With his hand, Man can make things, create them,
manage them. Man’s hand is a symbol of his product. But our hands also have
palms; and with this palm we micromanage—we paint with it, write, count money.
While we can sense touch with our entire body, the greatest sensation is
obtained through our palms. The palms of our hands, therefore, are a symbol of
our true control, control and dexterity that only a human can obtain.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">And just
like our hands, we have our legs. The leg is used to stand steadily on the
ground we live on. The leg also helps us walk, reach our destination, march on.
And, just like the hand, the leg has a foot. The foot controls our posture; it
stabilizes us. Our posture is that of humans—unlike the beasts, who can stand
on both feet but feel unstable at that. Our stability is given to us by our
feet.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">Our legs
also have thighs. This is the upper part of the leg, located between the pelvis
and the knee. The thigh is made of a large bone and a mass of muscles, among
them the largest muscle of our body. The composition of the muscles includes
blood vessels as well as part of the nervous system, responsible for supplying
and innervating the leg. When the thigh is cramping (triggered by the nervous
system), we feel a great deal of pain, pain that even a toothache cannot match
(I speak from experience!). Paralysis in this system will decommission the
entire leg, and the person will lose the capacity to walk or to stand.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">So, we
can say that the headquarters of the leg is in the thigh and the “hollow of the
thigh” micromanages the leg, like the palm micromanages the hand. To conclude:
Man’s direction and navigation system is in his legs. Man can walk here and
there, and the control of these actions is operated by the part of the nervous
system that manages the thigh. The “hollow of the thigh” is the wheel of the
navigation system.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And when he saw that he prevailed not
against him ….</strong></p>                  
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>He touched the hollow of his thigh.</strong>          Touched, not hit. The purpose of the intruder was to hit
Jacob’s hollow of the thigh and paralyze it; he wanted to paralyze Jacob’s
direction system, but he could not prevail against him. He did not succeed, and
eventually the stroke turned into a soft touch.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">In order
to truly reveal the intruder’s failure, one must analyze the second struggle,
within the intruder himself, and examine its results. But the Torah does not
refer to this struggle with a single word, and revolves around Jacob’s war
against the intruder only. We can only imagine the bloody fight between the two
entities on the other battlefield. Eventually, the brain will succumb to the
Original Conscious Mind and lose its virtue, because the brain also merely
touched the mind or barely scratched it.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">How do I
know this outcome? Had Jacob’s mind lost the battle, Jacob’s direction system
would have been left injured and paralyzed, because the mind’s role (as
mentioned above) is to find the direction across the chain of information,
using the trait of continuity of the links. But Jacob’s direction system was
not, as we all know, harmed; although he was touched at the hollow of his
thigh—his wheel—it is still in place, working well. A minor setback, but no
real damage.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And the hollow of Jacob's thigh was
strained, as he wrestled with him.</strong>          As I said, a
minor setback was all that it caused.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And he said: 'Let me go, for the day
breaketh.' And he said: 'I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.'</strong></p>                  
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And he</strong>          (the
intruder) 
<strong>said</strong>          (unto
Jacob)
<strong>: 'Let me go, for the day
breaketh.'</strong>          Here we see the true property of a winner. Jacob
definitely won the combat and was expected to remove the intruder and be rid of
him. The entire struggle was because of the intruder’s forceful invasion of
Jacob’s inner arena, forcing Jacob to combat, although Jacob is so far away in
nature from this, for he dwells in his tent, harvesting life in peace.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Here,
however, we see another property of Jacob the man: instead of casting the
intruder away, he only now begins 
<em>his</em>          combat. The combat of a winner.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Jacob
collects the small fragments that the struggle caused and requests, as any
professional warrior, to learn from the battle and closely evaluate his
intruding enemy. This is the same enemy who lies at his mercy, humiliated,
beaten, torn, and vanquished. He is his prisoner and Jacob wishes to study him
closely, learn everything about him, his nature, and his capabilities in
particular. 
<em>Know your enemy</em>         . Jacob knows the importance of this phrase.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And he said: 'Let me go, for the day
breaketh.'</strong></p>                  
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
defeated enemy said to the victorious, “Release me, you have nothing to do with
me. You are victorious, and the battle is over. I could not prevail against
you, and the Original Conscious Mind that you have leaned towards since your
youth has conquered your brain.”</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">Now they
walk hand in hand, and the mind gives the brain the trait of continuity. And lo
and behold, the brain simply nods and accepts the new trait as common knowledge!
It is against its nature, but what can one do?</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">“You,
Jacob, have beaten nature and you have beaten me, so there is nothing left to
do with me. Release me, because dawn is coming and this fight cannot continue
into the hours of light, can’t you see, Jacob? Morning comes. Don’t you
remember, Jacob? A struggle like this, within man, can only last until the day
breaks, until man wakes yp for work and the various entities enter this arena.
The man is not alone during the day for his isolation expired.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And he said: 'I will not let thee go'</strong></p>                   
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And he</strong>          (Jacob,
the winner)
<strong> said</strong>          (unto
the defeated)
<strong>: 'I will not let
thee go.'</strong>          “You will not teach me how to do my conduct, I will manage
my own affairs. And my affairs are as follows.”</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>'I will not let thee go, except thou bless
me.'</strong>          Until you will bless me. Here we must explore
a new term—blessing—which sometimes also appears as a verb, “to bless”. The
term is also mentioned in the text of the Fifth Expansion, so I will have to
talk about it eventually. Better sooner than later.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The term
or verb “to bless” (
<em>Levarech</em>         ) is composed of two verbs that rely on one
another:</p>         
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="direction: ltr;">·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<em>Levarech</em>          (from the noun 
<em>Rach</em>         , soft)—to make the subject soft,
softened, pleasant.</p>          
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="direction: ltr;">·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<em>Levarech</em>          (from the noun 
<em>Berech</em>         , knee)—to make the subject kneel,
force it to surrender, subdue it to one’s will, force something onto it.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Thus, if
I ask someone to bless me, I ask them to soften something for me, to make it
more cushioned, convenient, soft; and the thing that I wish to make soft will
then surrender, kneel before me and be subjected to my will.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Therefore,
when one decides to bless someone, one acknowledges that the person aims for an
unattainable target and so the target must be softened, and only then can it be
subjected to the blessed one’s will.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">It is absurd,
for example, that God (in his standard meaning) will bless Man. After all, God
is almighty and Man needs so much—health, money, happiness. God can make Man
happy; he can give him wealth or health; so, it is absurd for God to bless
where he can simply give. Imagine, if you will, that I were to go to a wealthy
man and ask for his help, and he would simply put his hand on my head and bless
me. You have the wealth and you mean to help—then please give me some money;
what good will your blessing (in its standard meaning) do?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">One asks
an entity for a blessing only when the entity cannot provide the thing one
wishes for. Then, without the physical availability of the thing, one asks the
entity’s help on a more virtual level—a mental level. One asks that the entity
will soften the thing, tell one about it, that it will explain it. This will
soften the target and help one make it available; subject it to one’s will.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">To be
blessed: to soften and to kneel. To make soft and to surrender.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And he</strong>          (Jacob
to the defeated) 
<strong>said: 'I will
not let thee go, except thou bless me.'</strong></p>                   
<p style="direction: ltr;">Jacob
says, “Until you will bless me, until you will explain the meaning of things to
make them easier for me, for only then will they succumb to me.”</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Jacob
addresses the angel in a very general way: “Bless me, explain the meaning of 
<em>things
</em>         to me, specify 
<em>things</em>         , soften 
<em>them</em>          for me …” This is in fact
the task Jacob undertakes, to learn a lesson from the struggle, to understand
the characteristics of his rival, to identify his strength, learn his weaknesses,
and grasp the rules of the game.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And he said unto him: 'What is thy name?'
And he said: 'Jacob.'</strong>          A name is a coordinate. When
I say ‘table’ I say that the coordinate I have obtained about the object before
me is the coordinate ‘table’—i.e. I have recognized this object to the level I
can refer to it as a table: it has four legs, I serve food on it, I can lean on
it or write on it.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
surrendering rival does as Jacobs asks of him and blesses him, for he has no
alternative. To begin this task, he approaches Jacob with a question: if you
wish to understand the essence and meaning of things, you must first know your
own coordinates, where you have come to, where you stand; you must define
yourself, and then continue onward. In other words, even if you knew everything
in the world and understood it, things will never materialize to more than
theory and have no practical use for you if you do not know yourself, your
capabilities, your obtained coordinates.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And he said unto him: 'What is thy name?'</strong>          What coordinates have you reached?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And he said: 'Jacob.'</strong>          My hand always held the heel of Esau; this is my coordinate. This
is where I have reached thus far, the location that I registered in my
navigation book. While I follow my own agenda, and I am a man who dwells in
tents and does not devour life; while I know how to pick life peacefully from
the consecutive links of information; my hand always holds Esau’s schooling. I
cannot release myself from reality, and I find myself struggling with this
school to eternity. I am an assistant in the coercion of this school, for my
hand always holds Esau’s heel.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And he said: 'Thy name shall be called no
more Jacob, but Israel; for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast
prevailed.'</strong></p>                  
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And he said:</strong>          the
surrendered rival, who is forced to bless and soften things for the victorious
Jacob, answers.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And he said: 'Thy name shall be called no
more Jacob'</strong>          This coordinate is wrong for you. I
therefore determine that you do not know yourself and your capabilities, and certainly
not your coordinates, well enough. This is why the world and all that is in it
will forever remain a theory to you, and not practice, until you will finally
know yourself and your capabilities; until you will recognize the practical
coordinate you have reached and know where you stand.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>'But Israel;'</strong>          This
is your actual coordinate, sir. This is where you have come to, please update
your maps.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>'For thou hast striven with God and with
men, and hast prevailed.'</strong></p>                   
<p style="direction: ltr;">The root
of the verb “striven” (
<em>Sharita</em>         ) is from the Hebrew word which means “to
rule”—to struggle for domination, fight for control, which is control over the
information.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>'For thou hast striven with God':</strong>          you have fought the war of the Original Conscious Mind and the
realistic brain—
<strong>'and hast
prevailed.'</strong>          You have won! You won this war and your brain eventually
accompanied the mind, hand in hand, to its daily hover over the continuum of
links.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Therefore,
please write down your current coordinate: 
<strong>Isra-El</strong>         , the man who fought
the war of the mind and was victorious.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And Jacob asked him, and said: 'Tell me, I
pray thee, thy name.' And he said: 'Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my
name?' And he blessed him there.</strong></p>                   
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And Jacob asked him, and said: 'Tell me, I
pray thee, thy name.'</strong>          Jacob got what he wanted: the
rival blessed him, reoriented his map of coordinates, or in other words
softened his basic data and surrendered them to him. Jacob already knows how to
manage the data in his surroundings, because he is aware of his capabilities
and where they may take him. He can now win the War or Wars. So what more can
he possibly want?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>'Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.'</strong>          Jacob knows his own capabilities but he wants to know those of his
rival as well. He wishes to grasp the volume of capabilities he has, to
estimate them in order to know how to handle them in the future. Jacob assumes
that he may have won this war only because his rival was weary or not at his
peak, or he may have not used all the ammunition he possesses. Now, Jacob
wishes to know every detail about the exact strength of his enemy.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And he said: 'Wherefore is it that thou
dost ask after my name?'</strong>          The answer of the rival
was surprising, to both Jacob and myself.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
rival answers that his strength, the strength of the enemy, depends on your
strength, the subject. If you are weak, he becomes stronger, and if you are
strong, he is weakened and may even be crushed and vanquished. So your
question, Jacob, is meaningless, because the state of artillery the enemy has,
completely depends on the forces you bring into the arena. 
<em>You</em>          will
determine what ammunition the enemy has against you and how it may be used.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">This is,
of course, the war between the brain and the mind—a total war, the War of Wars.
This is also the war that Jacobs is concerned about, and wants to know
everything about it—from its conduct, to the enemy strength, means of defense.
To speak in more contemporary terms, Jacob wants to assess his state for the
long run, and asked the enemy, who is for now his prisoner, for answers. Jacob has
asked the enemy to bless him again now, meaning to ease the information
relevant to this point and surrender them to him so that Jacob may gain control
of them.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
blesser replies: your request is irrelevant as are your concerns; for the
information you seek does not exist. The enemy rises as soon as your mind
weakens and relies on the realistic brain. The enemy is instantly gone when
your mind revives, regaining its trait of spatial mobility and can once again
hop between the links of information.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>'Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after
my name?'</strong>          This is why your question about my
strength is irrelevant. But, in reality, this short and lacking answer conceals
quantitative data that were not clear to Jacob. Now, these data are softened
and surrendered to him.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And he blessed him there.</strong>          Jacob found the answer 
<em>there</em>         , he was blessed again here as
well, and this blessing was no less valuable than the previous one.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And Jacob called the name of the place
Peniel: 'for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.'</strong></p>                  
<p style="direction: ltr;">I assume
that anyone who came this far can by now understand basic terms related to the
war fought by Jacob, and any man actually; terms like conscious mind, brain,
reality, information, trait of mobility, trait of continuity, the two parts of
information, etc. Will you agree that it is hard to explain to a person from
this age the meaning of this war—the struggle between the mind and the brain?
That if we pick a man from the street, and tell him of the struggle that occurs
in every man, he will simply ask, “What is the difference between the brain and
the mind? Why shouldn’t we be realists? And who says the mind is wiser than the
brain?”</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">It will
not be easy to explain to him that, in addition to the mind there is the
Original Conscious Mind, which was lost to us. Most probably that if you do try
he will back away slowly, wave, and call the police.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">To this
man from the street and any man or woman, the author of the Torah wrote the
first chapter—to reintroduce the original terms and align the reader with them.
To help us understand the original terms once more, to know them, to know our
Original Conscious Mind and use it—because the possibilities are infinite.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Now the
reader acknowledges his Original Conscious Mind and all the relevant terminology;
but here, as we said, appears the second obstacle, stopping the reader’s
progress with his Original Conscious Mind: here there is a struggle between the
brain and the mind, between Man and reality, between the mundane terminology
and the new terminology, which suddenly changes everything.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">If we
wish to accurately point to the moment the confrontation started, it is when
Man first encounters the new information. Once Man understands the information
he is faced with his consciousness and this is the moment of his “big bang.”
All the information he collected thus far is now shattered, threatening
everything he has learned and internalized. Now, when he finally understands
things completely, the existence of his knowledge is threatened. The reason is one
that was previously described: the brain!</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">When the
brain processes the Original Picture and its details, it rises and rejects the
information completely, because there cannot be two hypotheses, one on top of
the other: the hypotheses that there are unidentified links of information, and
to assume these links are continuous. The resistance is understood, which is
why the only one who can address it is the mind, which must take the brain by
its hand and travel with it, show the brain it’s perspective, show it the
continuum of links, the trait of continuity.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
brain will calm down and dismiss its rejection, because the mind showed it one
of the two missing variables. The brain has seen the trait of continuity; and
if that exists, the brain may assume that the links of information, which this
continuum applies to, also exist. The second variable is solved and the brain
may accept the equation. But life goes on, and quickly there is another
equation with two unknown variables; the theory of the mind, once again, claims
the second equation also has continuity, the brain passionately rejects it once
more, and the mind is the only entity in the universe that can make the brain
withdraw its rejection. The mind must once again stroll with the brain, hand in
hand. This is the only way.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">If one
ignores the pesky mind and relieves the brain from the task of strolling with
the mind, at least one of the following may occur.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
equation with the two variables falls through the cracks, and the one picking
it up first is the brain, who uses the equation as it sees fit. It does that
right in front of the mind’s agonizing gaze, who knows for certain that this is
neither the right nor appropriate way to handle the equation. But, alas, the
mind has no one to blame but itself.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Later,
as the equations multiply and the mind repeatedly ignores the brain and its
burden, this disregard becomes intended—it morphs into repression, a mechanism
the mind created to ultimately quiet its agony. It does not have to suffer
torment each time anew when the brain does as it chooses. Thus, repression soon
turns into a habit and the mind gets used to the brain’s methodology and gives
itself to the brain’s ways; now the mind relies on the brain and its fading
begins. This is the beginning of Man’s end.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">But this
is just one of many facets of Man’s encounter with the new information. The
encounter, we saw, leads to a confrontation between the brain and the mind and
the result of this confrontation may differ, depending on the mind’s behavior
in the struggle. The above is an extremist example of the mind’s indifference,
where apathy becomes a habit and the mind withers and crashes. But we also
studied two other examples of the mind’s possible behaviors in this
confrontation: the expanded example of Jacob, where the mind was significantly
active and fierce; and the classical example of Eve, where the mind exhibited a
typical slothful behavior—which is one level below indifference.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">There is
another side to demonstrate, which is nothing like the abovementioned. That is
the case where the mind takes the reins and subjects the brain to its will.
While this neutralizes the brain’s objections, it also neutralizes a great deal
of its function. The brain ceases to analyze complex data and settles for
emergency analysis only, such as seeing, hearing, tasting and performing other
essential tasks. But to think, to analyze information—that is left to the mind.
However, the mind cannot think by itself, and so the mind follows its path
without thinking, like the Good Soldier who follows his captain to the field of
fire, for better or worse.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">This new
side of the mind is common among humans and represents a state where the mind
directs the brain and eliminates its function. This causes the man to lose his
orientation in reality, because the representative of reality within him does
not function.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">This is
the case, for example, with fanatic extremists who operate in the world by set
and defined principles that will not budge. Such as the suicide bombers, and
nationalists who believe that they operate out of a clear and defined
principle. Or the extremists who are willing to murder their own daughters just
to protect a blind principle, such as the family honor. Jephthah of Gilad,
mentioned in the Book of Judges, followed his principles blindly, as well as
contemporary radical religious groups who operate by a specific, defined,
guiding principle.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Please
remember that the mind only recognizes the 
<strong>direction</strong>         , thanks to its
capacity to identify the trait of continuity; these radical principles are
therefore a product of the mind.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">I would
like to add that, indeed, the vermin infested both parties; the brain, who
rejects the mind until it relies on it and withers away, and the mind, who
enslaves the brain and goes down with it.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">In the
war of Jacob, he subdues the person who invaded his territory to conduct the
war of Jacob’s mind and brain in that arena. Jacob did not want this struggle
to begin with, which is why he rejects the invader who forces this struggle
upon him and declares him the enemy. He fights him, vanquishes him, and manages
to remove this struggle from his agenda.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">However,
nothing in the documentation of that war mentions the war of the mind and the
brain. While there is documentation of the confrontation and the struggle, but
not the war in which one must eliminate the enemy and delete its existence.
Jacob’s mind did not eliminate his brain; on the contrary, once Jacob won, his
brain eventually walked hand in hand with his mind on its daily walk along the
continuum of links of information.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">At the
end of the war, if you remember, Jacob was awarded the sign (or coordinate)
“Israel.” The citation committee must register the following reasons.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>'For I have seen God face to face':</strong>          because I fought the war of the Original Conscious Mind and the
realistic brain, and—
<strong>'prevailed.'</strong>         
I have won!</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Jacob
won and his brain eventually walked hand in hand with his mind to its daily
walk along the continuum of links of information.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">This is
my reply to the above argument. The mind cannot think without the brain, even
if it sees the direction and identifies it on its own. The mind needs the brain
in order to progress on its own course. The brain, on the other hand,
can indeed think without the mind, but the chain of information that feeds its
thinking is finite and limited, while that of the mind is endless and infinite.
Thus, the best solution is to go together, hand in hand, wisely jumping between
the consecutive, endless links. Together, they know where to go and how to
maintain progress; between them, they have both the looks and brains.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
intermission is over, and we return to the mind that overcame the brain and
neutralized it. This is the second and common facet that reveals itself when
Man encounters the new information and understands it. Note that the extremist
groups we mentioned above never encountered the new information and did
not recognize the mechanism of the Original Conscious Mind; they are of our
empty generation, who cannot even recognize the disguised mind.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">I, on
the other hand, speak of the other facet, derived from the person who did
encounter the new information and understood it. This is a person whose
mind neutralized his brain as a direct result of the new information, which the
brain acknowledged and accepted. That person understands the theoretical
information thoroughly and also understands the place of the Original Conscious
Mind and its function in space.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Note
that all the new information that person accepted and understood on a
theoretical level was also understood thoroughly, and as a result of that he
now decided to listen to the advice of his mind and to take away his brain’s
right to automatically object and reject it. Imagine a person that underwent
this change overnight, and as of now he must consider his mind and not
immediately follow his brain. This person might end up in an asylum for the
mentally ill within hours. Yes, he can very well become insane by this. 
<em>What
should I do now?</em>          He will ask himself. 
<em>Should I follow my realistic brain
or the clear direction of my mind?</em>          Take an hour of your life and count the
number of times you may encounter this question in various situations that
occur, to realize what might happen to that person.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Let us
assume that, in the case of this hypothetical person, he decides to go against
the current and follow the call of his mind for once. Still, nothing assures
him that the environment will also accept this decision and align with it. His
surrounding’s response will definitely affect the aftermath of that decision,
and this will undermine the confidence of that decision. On the other hand, if
said person would follow the advice of his brain, his mind will not be at
peace. And this is just one incident of many that he encounters daily, all of
which are miniaturized wars on his decision-making process, attacking him on an
hourly basis!</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">Thus,
after trying to follow the original path in several incidents, the defense
mechanisms that protect that person from insanity will kick in and he will stop
making decisions, for it is better to not decide than forever live in doubt;
better to omit than to practice and suffer misery. After a few attempts, his
hands will be tied, and he will no longer know what to do, how to decide, where
to go—or perhaps it is best to stop entirely and cease progress. The latter
will seem the best approach for anyone wishing to maintain their sanity.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">At this
point one may wonder, 
<em>so what can I do? If I want to regain my Original
Conscious Mind, to have it stroll hand in hand with the brain so we can all
advance in the right direction, how may I accomplish it?</em>          Indeed, how can
one find the theoretical law for the practical sphere?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">This is
the same question that the author of the Torah answer when describing the
struggle of Jacob. The confrontation, as it was documented and analyzed herein,
was not between Jacob’s mind and his brain but between Jacob and the 
<em>idea</em>         
that represents the contradiction between his mind and his brain. Jacob could
not ignore this contradiction because it existed, but he wished to hold it
back, to express his resentment of its very existence. Jacob tried to use the
theoretical information to hold back the contradiction; this is his nature and
way of life, as we saw in the story of the pottage where we learned which
school he associated himself with.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">So, we
conclude that Jacob used the theoretical information in line with his approach,
with his natural attitude in life. When I say theoretical information I mean
the Original Complete Picture that one can gaze upon through one of the seven
expansions that the author of the Torah created for us. I believe that Jacob
did not need these expansions of the Torah, because he was raised into the
Original Picture, inherited it from his ancestors.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Still
the question remains: what should one do? The answer is to choose a lifestyle
that is based on the Original Picture and recruit the theoretical information
that is available to you. This is a process that can occur and climax over many
years, and will certainly see ups and down, mistakes and failures, successes
and disappointments, and so on.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">A person
who freely decides to choose this way of life can use the theoretical
information as a map of everything, something to fold and keep in his pocket,
and when he is lost he can simply take the map out, have a look and be back on
track. This man, even in the Sahara desert, will not be lost for he has a map
in his pocket that guides him, and this is his advantage—that the theoretical
information will always be available to him. Even if he will fall and fail, or
simply forget what it felt like, he can always decide to return to the
stability of his mind and brain. He has a map in his pocket that will direct
his straight to the Original Conscious Mind. Others lacking this advantage, and
wishing to visit a new path that they heard of one day, will not have a map to
guide them there and back.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">In
conclusion, those who receive the theoretical information and decide to use it
immediately will necessarily risk what is left of their stability—both mentally
and physically, aspects which the mind and brain are respectively responsible
for. Soon enough the allegedly “right” decision will come along—to neutralize
both the brain and what is left of the mind. This is the result of the first
confrontation, when one put the mind and brain together and forces their
meeting; none of the entities accepts the existence of the other, and so each
accepts the other’s decision as a forced one. Because each entity feels that a
decision was forced upon it, they both resist any activity. There are other
effects of this incident, such as a drastic hurling of stability, which can
also be referred to as insanity.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Jacob’s
father, Isaac, reached this dangerous position when he received the Original
Full Picture from his father, Abraham, and they both progressed up to the Third
Expansion (the Third Day). Isaac deteriorated quickly into a pit where he was
bound and helpless, and was nearly lost if it wasn’t for his father, who
noticed this process that his son underwent and untied him immediately. The
fine details of this image are fascinating (Genesis 22). This is one of the
images that may arise from the forced meeting between the brain and the mind,
and the author of the Torah decided to add it to the other pictures.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Anyway,
Jacob was saved from this dangerous position, because the encounter between his
mind and his brain occurred in the framework of a lifestyle he had adapted long
beforehand.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And Jacob called the name of the place
Peniel: 'for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.'</strong>          Don’t forget that God, in this context, is the Original Conscious
Mind.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And Jacob called the name of the place
Peniel:</strong>          Jacob brought his book of achievements and
marked the coordinate he reached, which is now named Peniel.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>'For I have seen God face to face, and my
life is preserved.'</strong>          Jacob wrote in his book the
initials of his achievements—Peniel [also sounds like 
<em>Face of God</em>          in
Hebrew]. He will understand the reference when he skims through the book some
day and sees the word Peniel; but we, the readers, will not be able to decipher
the initials of such personal and intimate terms. This is why the author of the
Torah had to explain it further:</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>'For I have seen God face to face, and my
life is preserved.'</strong>          Jacob considers this an
accomplishment. Actually, only then did he notice his lifestyle, which enabled
the brain-mind encounter in which such crucial decisions and calls were made.
Nevertheless, despite the encounter and the decisions, Jacob remains with his
sanity and his hands unbound. This he considers an accomplishment, which he
credits in favor of the lifestyle he adopted beforehand. His father Isaac will
surely approve of his son’s accomplishment and give his seal of approval whole
heartedly.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And the sun rose upon him as he passed over
Peniel, and he limped upon his thigh.</strong>          This is how
Jacob passed his “night”—the part derived of the full day, the Original Full
Picture.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Remember
that the “night” contains the unknown, dark information that Man did not
discover yet, and at night Man sleeps over that information. He thinks about
it, how will he harvest it on the morrow, how will he control it, create a bond
with it. The man thinks in general terms, and here he is meditating alone and
sinks to his own deeps.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Here,
the connection between the mind and the brain is formed and the mind tries to
take the brain on its daily trip and introduce the continuous links to the
brain. These moments are where the meeting between the main players takes
place—the brain and the mind, and their encounter can last until dawn, until
Man wakes up to his day, and other entities enter their arena. Then the
isolation expires and the business meeting between the brain and the mind is
finished. With these words (more or less), the author of the Torah opens the
meeting protocol of Jacob’s mind 
<em>vs.</em>          brain session.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And
Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of
the day.</strong>          We have meticulously read the protocol of
that meeting, and studied everything that occurred during that session.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And the sun rose:</strong>          the night is over and the sun is up; Jacob’s workday begins.
Foreign entities enter Jacob’s personal arena, and the isolation of that
location is defeated. The business meeting between the mind and brain is
finished.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
author of the Torah summarizes this meeting in two main clauses:</p>         
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="direction: ltr;">1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The
accomplishment that Jacob registered when he reached Peniel.</p>          
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="direction: ltr;">2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The slight
injury his steering system suffered.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Armed
with these two coordinates, Jacob begins his day.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And the sun rose upon him as he passed over
Peniel, and he limped upon his thigh.</strong>          This is truly
the work of an artist.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>Therefore the children of Israel eat not
the sinew of the thigh-vein which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this
day; because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh, even in the sinew of the
thigh-vein.</strong></p>                  
<p style="direction: ltr;">We have
already completed our study of the term 
<strong>ISRAEL</strong>          and its two exclusive
parts—
<strong>ISRA-EL</strong>         . Now we need one more term, derived from it, that will
connect us with the Fifth Expansion and the other terms we gathered so we can
go back, armed and ready, to our picture. That term is “
<strong>the children of
Israel.</strong>         ”</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">But who
are the children of Israel? To fully understand this term, I must first know
who my own sons are. While I know my neighbor, they resemble me better.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The word
<em>Ben</em>          (child, son) stems from the word 
<em>Livnot</em>          (to build). Usually
one builds a home, a structure, a city; but one can also construct a thought, a
concept. In one of the previous pictures I have elaborated upon the term
“waters under the heaven,” i.e. the reality, the information that one
recognized and used to build his reality, his technology, machines, and
airplanes. But I also emphasized that man did not actually create the airplane
but recognized it; his production amounts to no more than identifying the information.
Someone on one of the websites where I published this essay responded with the
following.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<em>Up
until now I thought there was a difference between a “discovery” and an
“invention”—we can discover things that exist in the world (like oxygen, fire,
etc.) but we can invent things that did not exist beforehand (like the cart,
the airplane, etc.). You claim that all “inventions” are actually
“discoveries,” and my question is—how do you know? How are you so sure that the
airplane (for example) existed forever?</em></p>                  
<p style="direction: ltr;">This is
my answer to that.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<em>You
differentiate between a discovery and an invention, and call the airplane an
invention, and you ask me how do I know that the airplane existed forever?</em></p>                  
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<em>I
believe you will agree with me that if it wasn’t for the wheel, we would have
never reached the airplane. There were hundreds of other inventions that
preceded the airplane and led to it. In other words, the “inventor” of the
airplane collected all the inventions that preceded the airplane, including an
endless amount of laws and disciplines and theories, and finally he saw an
“idea” that his predecessors did not think of, added it to the brew and voil&#224; —the
airplane flies. If we separate the inventor’s idea from the kettle he cooked up
the airplane in, will the idea in itself have existence five thousand years
ago? Of course not, because without the ideas that came before and led to it,
it could never exist.</em></p>                   
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<em>Just
as easily, I can go to the wheel and ask the same question: is the wheel a
discovery that always existed in our sphere, or was it just created when it was
invented? And just as easily, I can handle this question following the same
principle. If it wasn’t for a billion ideas and laws and doctrines and theories
that preceded the wheel we would not have reached it, and the inventor of the
wheel simply collected all the available findings he had, added another idea
that will tie them together, and thus the wheel was born. In other words, the
inventor “identified” the idea that connected the other ideas scattered before
him, meaning between the various chains of information laid before him, and
when all the chains connected together a long chain of information was created.
While it seemed new, it was no more than a collection of millions of chains
that did exist beforehand. Now that we see all of the chains together we think
we have something else at hand, something new and innovative.</em></p>                   
<p style="direction: ltr;">What I
meant to say was that the wheel and the engine are both the children of the
airplane that built it. The airplane has a million other children—discoveries
that came before it, that helped constructing it. It is not by chance that the
letters that compose the word 
<em>Ben</em>          (áð), child, appear in the
Hebrew words 
<em>Even</em>          (àáï), stone, and 
<em>Levena</em>          (ìáðä),
brick, both used to build (ìáðåú) a home. The letter also
appears in the word 
<em>Tovana</em>          (úåáðä), an insight, the
building brick of ideas, as well as 
<em>Tavnit</em>          (úáðéú),
pattern, and 
<em>Teven</em>          (úáï), hay, which also appears
in the Bible in context with construction: 
<strong>‘Ye shall no more give the people
straw to make brick, as heretofore. Let them go and gather straw for
themselves’</strong>          (Exodus, 5:7).</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">After
this quick Hebrew lesson, we can return to the children. And, as we all know,
the children are the builders of the family. I myself have four sons and I can
say “these are my children,” but the question is how did these sons come to me?
Who are these children?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">Now
there’s a silly question if I ever heard one. One day the electricity went out
and we were left without television. And on that day, sperm found egg and nine
months, later we had Erez, the first born that carries the exact genetic
information of my wife and me, and our entire generation. His physical
structure, his physical capacities, and his behavior were very similar to ours
and those of our generation; not identical, but very similar.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">No one
will mistake the origin of Erez, even without a paternity test sent to the lab.
Erez is a Man; moreover, he is a Jewish man. His behavior and physical
structure, as well as other things will attest to this legacy of his, and if
you will want to point to his “close” family, even in a database of millions of
pictures you will immediately identify the picture of his parents due to his
similarity to them both. I have a picture of me when I was his age, and we are
just like peas in a pod.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">If you
still want to verify that he is indeed our son—you can just talk to him and
compare his behavior with that of his parents. I’m sure this will ease your
mind about the matter. If you still wish to confirm his origin and family and have
the time for all these tests—do you know how long it takes to examine millions
of photographs? Just take a DNA sample of his parents and of another man from
his synagogue community and send them over to the lab.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">And now
we come to the biggest question of all: what about the conscious mind? What
does the mind have to do with genetics? Do nucleic acids store the conscious
mind?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">Nucleic
acids are the genetic material that is transferred hereditarily among all
living beings, including humans. These molecules, which contain the hereditary
information, have a physical existence; we recognize them and called their
basic information unit “a gene.” The hereditary data, or the links of
hereditary information, were recognized by Man in the molecules that compose living
beings and he called them DNA and RNA and hundreds of other names of genes that
Man used to code the links of information he identified.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">What
happens to the genetic material when a living creature dies? Will the genetic
substance continue to exist?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
answer is yes, of course. Even when you pluck a hair off the scalp of a dead
man, it still carries the same hereditary information he had when he was alive.
But we all know that the hereditary molecules have the capacity to generate
life. They can replicate themselves, generate energy, and more. So, what would
cause these molecules to cease all activity and become inanimate?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">We know,
for example, that something that cannot generate energy is not considered
alive, even if it contains hereditary information—such as, for example,
viruses. So we can simplify it further and define the trait of auto-energy
generation as the trait of life. The question remains, however: what causes a
change in the genetic material’s status—i.e. from a molecule that generates life
to an inanimate thing that will no longer generate life?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
answer is, any change in the conditions surrounding the genetic material; like
the weather, a pathogen, or anything else that affects the nucleic acids or,
alternatively, is removed from it, may cause it to change its status and cease
activity. I can call this intruding entity “an information link,” because it
must have a physical existence and all material in this world possess a certain
amount of information.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Simultaneously,
we must assume that whatever caused these nucleic acids to reproduce and create
life is a change in their environmental conditions. In other words, an
information link entered the surroundings and gave that molecule life, which
activated the genetic, hereditary trait of the nucleic acid. Of course, this is
a very rough assumption that claims that the genetic molecules existed since
the beginning and only when the foreign information link came to activate it
did it gain the hereditary capacity to generate life. It is rude to assume that
genetic substance was created from thin air, and I could be chastened by any
researcher for such rudeness.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Nevertheless,
even if I separate the genetic substance to its particles and divide its
construction to specific steps—my assumption will still remain valid. Some sort
of 
<em>change</em>          caused the existence of this first, most basic form of the
genetic substance, and it grew and developed into the form it possesses
today—be it the form of a virus, a worm or a human being.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">I must
assume that there were numerous, 
<strong>consecutive,</strong>          and dormant links of
information in the scope of the main chain, and that a mobile link came from 
<em>somewhere</em>         ,
identified their sequence and joined them. By doing so, the new link changed
the sequence, and refused to let go during its entire changing
process—otherwise there would not be a developmental process with a specific
beginning. Any genetic substance developed from a certain starting point to a
certain ending (or current) point. This is why we can witness the transition from
the inanimate to the animate.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">This is
how I can 
<strong>see</strong>          the transition; I do not explain it, because in every
explanation or theory I must see the existence of the basic, dormant sequence
of the links of information, relayed on the mainframe of the continuum. I
should also see the mobile link that identified their trait of continuity and
joined them—i.e. brought the trait of mobility (life) to these dormant links,
because once it joined them they all became mobile and jump from one stage of
development to another. The evolutionary process now affects them, to reach its
peak in later stages.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">As I
mentioned a few pages ago: the human conscious mind, in its essence, is a
mobile information link and that is what differentiates it from the other
consecutive, dormant links which are relayed on the endless continuum of
information. These consecutive links await a mobile links that will arrive and
home on their location; that will identify their sequence. They await the
mobile link to bring them to life and transform them from inanimate, motile
links to live and mobile ones.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<em>This</em>          is the mother of all theories.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>In
the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</strong>          (Genesis, 1:1)The human conscious, AKA God, a mobile link of
information, was born into a chain of information with dormant, consecutive
links that go on forever. It began to comb that continuum and identify the
sequences of the links relayed before it. The journey started from the earth.
The same formula was later described for beginner readers, who could not
understand the Full Picture from its beginning.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>Then
the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</strong>          (Genesis, 2:7) I should remind you here that:</p>         
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="direction: ltr;">·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<strong>
<em>Yehaveh
</em></strong>                  (the true interpretation of the word éäåä,
commonly translated as 
<em>The LORD</em>         )is the codename of the dynamics
that operate within the endless continuum of information;</p>          
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="direction: ltr;">·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<strong>
<em>Yehaveh
Echad</em></strong>                   (will be one) states that it exists in
present and will continue to exist for eternity, because all the information in
the universe is located on a single continuum of information.</p>          
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="direction: ltr;">·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<strong>
<em>Elohim</em></strong>                   (the Conscious Mind, in this context,
but commonly translated as 
<em>God</em>         ) is the guide, the instructor, the
director who stands at the top of the control center of the thinking human.</p>          
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="direction: ltr;">·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<strong>
<em>Yehaveh
Elohim</em></strong>                   (herein misinterpreted as The LORD God)
is the dynamic that operates in space and which also serves as a guide and
director for the human conscious mind, which notices this dynamic and considers
it as its leading, father-like figure.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And
the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground:</strong>         
man, or the links of information that compose the genetic material of human
beings during each of their developmental, evolutionary stages, are a part of
the dust of the ground. This means that they were like any other dormant
consecutive link, composed of the basic material of the universe.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life:</strong>          then
came the mobile link of information and recognized the sequence of the links of
Man. It harvested those links and wished to move along with them, develop
through them, travel accompanied by them. It transformed them from a dormant
inanimate material to a live and animate material. It breathed the breath of
life into their nostrils and now they are a living, breathing and beating
substance.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And
man became a living soul:</strong>          these words summarize the
story of how the links of information of Man as a body, a machine, became a
being with the will to live, to move, to 
<em>linposh</em>          (reside) in the sphere
of the endless continuum. [The verb 
<em>linposh</em>          in Hebrew stems from 
<em>Pishon</em>         ,
the name of the one river that goes through Eden. This is the only whole
channel that allows access to the complete continuum.]</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>Then
the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</strong>          As mentioned in the book of Genesis, the mobile link of
information, the conscious mind, came out for a walk along the continuum of
information to observe and recognize the links. It recognized the links of the
human body, homed in on them and wished to travel with them. Only then did this
body turn from inanimate clay to living, mobile flesh.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
conscious mind, therefore, builds its path through the human body. Before it
recognized it, the mind was only hovering over the chain of information,
floating in space with no direction or purpose, because it could not register
any coordinate on the continuum—for even if the mind had an identity, it did
not have a body. The mind was one of the three entities that the author of the
Torah documented in the second verse (Genesis, 2:7), right after he presented
the Full Picture in the first verse (Genesis, 1:1). Through the second verse,
the author wished to begin the process of expanding the picture and simplifying
it so that Man will receive it. Thus, he states, in the second verse, the
position of the three entities that formed the Full Picture: the mind, the
information and the earth.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">In fact,
the earth is part of the universe, part of the chain of information; but the
author of the Torah gave it a unique position because the earth represents the
first coordinate that the mind registered and from which it began its journey
along the continuum of information. The following verses describe the position
of the mind:</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And
the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters.</strong>          The conscious mind, before recognizing the human body, simply
hovered above the continuum of information. As mentioned, it could not register
any coordinate during this journey because even though it had a personality,
for the links of information that it hovered over reflected matter to it, it
was roaming a materialistic universe but could not reflect matter on it own. It
was a substance-less link of information, which is why, when it came across the
substance—the links of information that reflected substance—it wished to exist
through them, with them, by them; it wished to be able to use them to register
the coordinates of the continuum it hovered hover, which is why the mind said:</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<strong>And God
said:</strong>          this is the first thing the mind said when it
encountered the links of information that reflected matter:</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<strong>‘Let
there be light.’</strong>          The mind said that the consecutive
links it encountered had a physical reflection. ‘let there be’—to exist, to be.
The light uncovers the thing that hides underneath, that which has not been
exposed yet. The mind expresses its wish that this light will expose the
physical reflection of the links.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<strong>And
there was light.</strong>          The physical reflection of the links
came to be. In this moment, the conscious mind obtained physical existence—i.e.
a human form. At that moment, Man was created, a human body with a mind, a
soul.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">From
that moment, the conscious mind could be counted as a physical identity and
register its coordinates of the continuum of information. Where once there was
identity with no physical existence, now the conscious mind is an identity with
a physical body.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Thus the
mind, which obtained a physical existence, no longer hovers aimlessly over the
continuum of information. Now it can register the coordinates it reaches on the
continuum and these coordinates are now called 
<em>achievements</em>         , so we can
say it 
<strong>builds</strong>          its achievements over the continuum of information using
its human body, one achievement after the other, one coordinate at a time.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">But
unfortunately, the mind not only builds; it can also destroy. We have studied
the self-destructive traits of the mind before, when it completely relies on
and is supported by the brain, or when it enslaves the brain and neutralizes
it. In either case, it brings destruction upon itself, as the walls crumble
around it, and achievement by achievement its coordinates—which the mind
registered tediously with its body—are gone.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">Note
that the mind uses the body as storage for the achievements it registers. The
body stores all the coordinates it reached, and the brain serves as the
incredible machine that will file the data and store them for future reference.
But it is true that the human body is not just a sophisticated vessel of
storage, but also a mobile vessel, that its sophistication level is also
mobile. In other words, it can store information and lose information,
depending on its mobility state—where it progresses and regresses.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Unfortunately,
the mind regresses and destroys that which it built, along with the body that
loses strength and regresses with the mind. The strength of the body is in its
storage capacity, and the information it had stored is depleted to the point of
regression that its partner, the mind, reached. Eventually the body will be
completely empty of information related to the progression of the mind, because
the mind will be completely shut down and will not need any coordinates to leap
from. This is the moment of comprehensive, complete destruction, the moment of
death; when the mind separates from the body, for there is no longer
justification or reason for their partnership. The vessel no longer stores
information relevant for its progress; in fact, it no longer really progresses
at all, and its trait of mobility is nearly gone completely.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Despite
this sad tale, there is another issue we must understand and isolate from the
rest of the story. As mentioned above, this sad tale has a tragic endings,
where the mind declined and the body withered, until eventually the mind had no
use of its partner, the body had nothing to offer the mind and their show was
over. The body died and the mind said its goodbyes.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The body
withered and died and the mind separated from it, but it did not die because it
still has its identity, even though it lost the physical existence that the
body provided. In addition, the separation made the mind lose a lot of its
original mobility trait, but still, its identity as a mobile information link
remains. Once again, it will aspire to regain physical existence, because that
will help it increase its mobility to a level where it can register new
coordinates, and then it will be able to progress along the continuum of
information and not just hover aimlessly over it.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The identity
of the link of information, at its moment of separation, is not identical to
the one it had when entering the body. During its short partnership with the
body, it improved certain traits and degraded others: courage, fearfulness,
compassion, apathy, mercy, cruelty, heroism, cowardice, stubbornness,
arbitrariness, pride, impatience, arrogance, generosity, miserliness,
resourcefulness, laziness, diligence, selfishness, humility, boastfulness, etc.
</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">In fact,
this list does not describe singular traits or even pairs, but a single trait
that the human language named its different levels and extremities in a
spectrum we can scale from 0 to 100. Take cruelty and mercy, for example. These
two extremities refer to the single trait, which peaks at compassion (100) and
sinks low at cruelty (0). The same goes for all the other traits. All of these
are a single trait that stems from the 
<strong>conscious mind’s trait of mobility</strong>         
and which the human language divided into numerous traits in order to identify
the levels on the spectra and recognize the trait’s rating.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">I cannot
describe this original trait other than by its original adjective: “mobility.”
I also cannot evaluate the rate of the traits that compose the root trait,
mobility. For example: which rate would compassion have on the maximum scale of
mobility? To be rated 100 could inhibit the mobility, because compassion can
also apply on cruel entities and strengthen then at your expense. This means
that cruelty can also somewhat contribute to one’s mobility. The same goes for
pride and humility, generosity and miserliness. What will be the proper rating
of each of these sub-traits that will generate the maximum score of mobility?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">This is
what the mind says on the Sixth Expansion, and I must quote again a few of its
notes.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And
God said: ‘Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.’</strong></p>                  
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>Image:
</strong>         this is the scanned image of the mind’s original
trait of mobility.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>Likeness:</strong>          this is also a scanned image of mobility, but 
<strong>in Man</strong>         . ‘Our
likeness’ refers to likeness to the image of the mind’s trait in Man.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And
God said: ‘Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.’</strong>          This is equivalent to, 
<strong>“[A]nd God said: ‘Let there be light.’</strong>         ”
The sequence of links that the mind encountered will have a physical
reflection; that the light will expose this reflection of the links, that it
will create a physical existence to the mind—a conscious human body (as
detailed above).</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>And
God said: ‘Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.’</strong>          That the physical existence of the mind will reflect its trait of
mobility from before it coupled with the body and even afterwards, when they
became a single unit. In other words, Man’s trait of mobility must reflect the
mobility of the mind. But herein lies the problem: Man’s trait of mobility is
composed of two elements, the mobility of the mind, and the mobility of the
vessel.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">While
the mind is an invaluable part of the body, each element has its own values:
the mobility of the mind has endless values, for that is the uniqueness of the
mind; the endless hovering over the chains of information—mobility and
endlessness. But Man’s maximum trait of mobility can be calculated by weighing
all the sub-traits that compose mobility, such as the values of one man’s pride
and humility, compassion and cruelty, etc. A man who will follow his conscious
mind alone will reduce his mobility, because he will aspire to reach maximum
values of compassion, generosity, respect, and so on, which will lead to
compassion for the cruel, generosity to the miser, respect to the dishonorable.
This will only empower the negative and reduce the individual’s strength. He
must also, therefore, have another aspect that will reflect the weight of these
values in addition to his original aspect, which naturally turns to the mind
and its endless mobility.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">This is
the basic reasoning for 
<strong>‘male and female created He them’</strong>         , for they are
two aspects of man which must integrate with man’s achievements. The female
side is the one that define values, as they must be if one wishes to achieve
the trait of endless mobility. This side represents the identity of the
Original Conscious Mind and reflects it as it is—with endless mobility. The
male side is the one that settles for remembering the values of the Original
Conscious Mind (endless mobility), but cannot specify the exact values. This
side only remembers the trait, leans towards it, and its values are calculated
and weighed in order to obtain this mobility.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">This is
why the author of the Torah used the plural form (‘Let us make man…’) when
speaking of the creation of Man. Two sides must be partners in the creation of
Man, because of their attachment to the original trait of mobility: the male
who remembers his bond to the values of the mind, and the female who specifies
the values of the mind, because her bond with the mind is direct.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Here we
detach from the Sixth Expansion and return to the mind, as it separates from
the body. We return to the moment of complete destruction of both partners and
the moment of their goodbye, for there is no longer a reason to maintain their
partnership, the body has no relevant information that may help the progress of
the mind, and since it progresses its trait of mobility anyway, is virtually
gone by now.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The body
is dead and the mind loses its physical existence; but its identity in its
current image still exists. It returns to space and hovers over it,
directionless and powerless, incapable of registering any coordinates in sight.
It loses its ability to progress, but its original trait of mobility screams in
its metaphysical bones, calling to advance, to move, to register coordinates of
the chains of information, without which it cannot go any further, and it says,
again and again, 
<strong>‘[L]et there be light … let us make [a] man in our image,
after our likeness ….’</strong></p>                  
<p style="direction: ltr;">Note
that the mind’s 
<strong>image</strong>          is always one and the same—the image does not and
will not change, for this is its trait of endless mobility, but the 
<strong>likeness</strong>         
indeed undergoes changes. Remember that the likeness is the weighed trait of
mobility in 
<strong>Man</strong>         , i.e. the weight of all the human traits that compose
the root trait, mobility, such as courage, kindness, fear, etc. The mind surely
acquired these traits while coupling its mobility with the human body,
mastering some and deserting others. Its level of human mobility changed, its
likeness changed and eventually changed its image upon separation from the
body. Now the mind is eager to harvest from the chain of information another
likeness that is specifically like it, because this is its current
physical location—this is where it ended up during its trip with the body, and
it cannot leave this place without its human form because its mobility capacity
was lost when it separated from the body.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Again,
it says: 
<strong>let us make [a] man in our image</strong>         , ‘let us’, for both aspects must
cooperate in order to accomplish this achievement: the female and the male will
make a “man” in their image, the endless trait of mobility that motivated them
and which they are attached to—by it, directly or indirectly.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>‘After
our likeness’</strong>         , means that the man will be created
after our likeness, because the man will have a defined identity, like that
which the mind reached with its former partner; a likeness to an identity that
was consolidated when the mind left the body and annulled their partnership. At
this point, the mind was at a defined level of values, which constructed
its identity: heroism, stubbornness, miserliness, courage, fear, compassion,
generosity, laziness, humility, diligence, arbitrariness, etc. The weight of
these values constructed the identity’s level of mobility.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">So, the
word “child” refers to the human identity that Man created in all its sallies
of life. In other words, a “child” is the weighed values Man obtained, values
that constructed the level of its mind’s mobility.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
Children of Israel is also a group whose identity was composed under a shared
roof. The same goes for the generation of the twentieth century; and in each
generation we can identify more and more subgroups that narrow the people to a
certain country, like Egyptians, Israelis, etc., and even to smaller
groups—people of the same ethnicity, community, clans, and families.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">My sons
are the identities composed under my specific, narrow roof. Or, if you will, my
sons are the identities that the 
<em>values</em>         , which compose the level of
mobility of their minds, are gathered under a shared and narrow canopy—which is
my roof.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">My wife
and I made these sons. This means that the conscious mind, which separated from
the identities of my sons during its previous round, stopped upon its
separation at a certain coordinate, and on that night when we had no
electricity and no television the mind said to itself 
<strong>‘let us make a man in
our image, after our likeness.’</strong></p>                  
<p style="direction: ltr;">There
are identities where the values that compose their minds’ level of mobility
have deteriorated so badly over the course of life, that they are
infinitesimal. The mobility of their mind is therefore infinitesimal, and so at
the ends of their life, the mind stops at the lowest level of life, and
sometimes it loses all memory of flexibility and mobility that its next stop is
not even Animalia—but rather plants or inanimate objects. The mind then screams
at the top of its metaphysical lungs, 
<strong>‘let us make a man in our image, after
our likeness,’</strong>          but none can hear it, for there are no human identities in
those far reaches that may respond to its call.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">During
one of the experiments done in the field of quantum theory, a research group
found a curious trait when inspecting the motion of a particle: the particle
had a certain type of motion during its measurement, but when it wasn’t being
observed it moved in a completely different type of motion. This was an
empirical finding, showing the trait of mobility as a behavior of a particle!
This was registering the voice of the mind.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Thus,
finally, we come to understand the full term of the Children of Israel, and we
can continue to the last verse that documents the struggle between Jacob and
the intruder.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">If you
recall, the struggle ended with Jacob’s victory, but he did not knockout his
enemy. The intruder still managed to stall Jacob and injure his directional
system at the hollow of his thigh, which is why Jacob had a minor limp.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">To
translate these terms to words we already understand, we can say that, while
Jacob knew how to recognize his Original Conscious Mind and could guide his way
through it, because he saw the mind’s path clearly through the sequence of
links of information, he still tried as best he could to maintain his natural
tendency: to be a man who dwells in tents and harvests life peacefully, not
devouring them frantically. Alas, he failed; reality forced its existence upon
him, forced his mind to confront it and his rational brain.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">I say,
“Reality forced itself,” as if reality was a being, and Jacob also resisted this
reality as if indeed it was an entity of sorts. Jacob could not deny the
existence of his rational brain nor could he ignore the inevitable conflict
between his brain and his mind, but he referred to the confrontation as if it
were forced upon him. His nature resisted the conflict and usually managed to
reject it and invited his mind and his brain to walk hand in hand on their
daily trip. He was one of the few men whose conscious mind never relied on his
brain and at the same time he never neutralized his brain in favor of his mind.
The duo, almost always, walked together, hand in hand.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">So the
original war Jacob fought was over the existence of the struggle that the duo 
<em>should</em>         
be having: conscious mind 
<em>vs.</em>          brain, one on one—a war to determine
whether he could uproot this struggle or not. In most cases, he was successful;
the struggle was postponed and his mind and brain walked together like young
lovers in the park. But sometimes he failed as well, and could not hold back
the struggle—and so it came: the mind fought the brain, and in such a direct
combat one of the partners must lose and the other be victorious—and Man is
always on the losing side. Jacob’s human identity, which represents his mind’s
trait of mobility, is the loser, and this is the source of Jacob’s slight
injury to the directional system—the hollow of his thigh, the control room of
the leg, which directs Man in his path. His trait of mobility as a human being
was injured and his identity could not register maximum mobility—he had a limp.
</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">Here we
see the clear-cut message that the author of the Torah tried to deliver: 
<em>you
cannot win the mind-brain war; one of the two will win, the other will lose,
and Man will forever go with the loser.</em></p>                  
<p style="direction: ltr;">This is
why the only way that Man may hope to win is if he brings his mind and brain to
walk together; when he trains himself to this lifestyle and acquires this
property to himself. Any other scenario will end with Man losing the most
important battle of his life. The following verse shows how the author of the
Torah chose to phrase this message and his unequivocal conclusion.</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the
thigh-vein which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day; because he
touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh, even in the sinew of the thigh-vein.</strong></p>                  
<p style="direction: ltr;">“Sinew,”
or tendon, is a string of tissue that connects muscles to bones. The sinew of
the thigh-vein is the tendon connected to the hollow of the thigh.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">As we
mentioned before, the leg directs the path of Man and determines where he will
turn. It has the largest and strongest bone of the body, the femur, which
carries the entire weight of the human body. This bone represents the
mechanical side of Man, the natural tendency, which he is accustomed himself to
and to which he feels good about.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">However,
sometimes Man changes his natural tendency and seeks another state where he
wishes to consciously control the bones—i.e. his natural tendency, in order to
adapt it, from time to time, to new conditions that occur. He wishes to improve
it, change it, or simply control its dose, and that is when Man takes control
and begins to dominate what was previously his natural tendency, which had
operated on autopilot.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
femur, the leg’s long and strong bone, represents the aspect that leads Man to
a certain direction in a natural, almost automatic fashion. Now, Man decides he
wishes to control his leg; he wishes to control each step of the way and
consciously decide on the desired direction of his path. This he does by a band
of tissue that connects the muscle to the mechanic bone. Through this
connecting band he can now fully control the leg, command it where to turn,
when to turn and at what angle. He will also provide the leg, through the
muscle, the amount of blood it requires for the effort of its work, meaning he
will now also control the leg’s speed and determination—not just the direction.
</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
string, made of fibrous tissue, which connects the hardened bone of the leg to
the muscle and through it to Man’s control center, is called the sinew of the
thigh-vein. This means that through the sinew of the thigh-vein Man can utilize
his full control of the leg.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">We now
return to the natural leg of Jacob, which was used to serve in the daily trip
his brain and mind took each day, hand in hand. This was his way of life, and
this was also the natural tendency of his leg—to walk with this beautiful
couple wherever they choose to go, and whichever direction they turn. There
were rare occasions in which the mind turned to the leg and asked it to walk in
a certain direction but the leg simply ignored it and politely rejected the
request: 
<em>either you two march together or you can forget about me, I’m not
going anywhere</em>         , it would say. The brain may also ask the leg to follow it
in a different direction, but the leg would stay put: 
<em>the two of you
together, or I will not take a single step; that is my natural direction, and
no one can budge me from it.</em>          These were the wars that Jacob always won,
where he did not let any party affect his way of life: brain and mind, hand in
hand, marching together forever.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">One day,
perhaps absentmindedly, Jacob decided to deviate from his natural tendency and
to regain control; to control his steps and his legs and to weigh the data
received from the mind who can identify the trait of continuity instead of the
realistic data that the brain shows him.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Jacob
processes the complete database, considers it and makes a decision: to walk in
a certain direction, according to the weighed results; he wasn’t wrong in that,
either, his decision was the right one, but his other party—I do not remember
if it was the brain or the mind—will not let him be. The “right” decision
became a burden and he wished he had never made it. The next day, he wished to
compensate the other party, advancing towards it, but once again, it does not
matter if he was right or wrong—the ignored party will not leave him alone, and
he could not be free of his misery. Here, Jacob began to limp, to lose his
sense of direction. When Man limps, he tires easily, and looks for shortcuts
even at the expense of his direction.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">At the
end of the day, even Jacob was crushed under this weight. The limp made him
crash completely. He no longer controlled either mind or brain, and he could
not bring them to travel together like in the good old days. The author of the
Torah describes, over the following chapters, the process of Jacob’s collapse.
For this was not an immediate event, and even our generation takes 70-80 years
until the parties leave their partnership. The author of the Torah also
described Jacob’s rise to greatness in the previous chapters; how he brought
his mind and brain to walk together, but we skipped those and went directly to
the moment of conflict and turn that Jacob experienced.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The turn
occurred when Jacob decided to give up his natural tendency and take matters
into his own hands: to consider, decide, and sort the data of his mind and
brain and to process them on his own.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the
thigh-vein which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day; because he
touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh, even in the sinew of the thigh-vein.</strong></p>                  
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
author of the Torah now speaks of the children of Jacob, the group of people
whose identity will be constructed under a single roof: Israel. Remember that a
“child” is the weighed values that Man has accomplished and which comprise the
level of his mind’s mobility.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
author of the Torah asks: 
<em>who were the children of Israel? What are the
characteristics of this group, which identity will be constructed under the
roof of Israel? Who are the children whose weighed values will build the level
of the minds’ mobility—reaching the mobility of Israel altogether?</em>          And the
final question: 
<em>how will this group reach its maximum level of mobility—that
which Jacob reached and for which he was named Israel?</em></p>                  
<p style="direction: ltr;">He
answers this question with his fine and sharp pen: 
<strong>Therefore
the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the thigh-vein which is upon the
hollow of the thigh, unto this day;</strong>          this group will never eat the 
<strong>fruits</strong>         
of the sinew of the thigh-vein, as long as it is lodged under the wings of
Israel’s prototype. This is true in each generation, in every moment unto the
day these sentences are being read.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The
other part of the verse was meant for those who are too lazy to think for
themselves and still wish to understand the meaning of things: 
<strong>because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh, even in the
sinew of the thigh-vein.</strong></p>                   
<p style="direction: ltr;">When he
reached his climax and had his mind and brain walk hand in hand, no one could
defeat him; nothing could stand in his way. Jacob the man, as an identity,
could not be vanquished. To use today’s slang, the identity of Jacob could not
shoot himself in the leg because only he could defeat himself, by leaning
towards his mind or his brain, i.e. when he chose to execute judgement, sort
the data of his mind and brain and process them separately.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">More
explicitly, Jacob did not have an alternative identity that could defeat him;
another identity had no chance to invade and sabotage him. His natural tendency
would reject it immediately; it would reject the very thought of using
judgement and sorting the data of the mind and the brain separately. That is
what the intruder tried to tell him, when he still tried to invade Jacob, the
man who reached his climax and brought his mind and brain to walk together,
hand in hand. The invader is the alternative identity who allegedly tried to
see whether it had any room with Jacob, if it could convince him to separate
his mind from his brain, but this alternative identity failed because the
answer is no, it had no room in Jacob, and Jacob threw it off the porch. Then
the alternative identity admitted its failure and recognized Jacob’s source of
power:</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>‘Israel; for thou hast striven with God and with men, and
hast prevailed.’</strong>          Israel, because you were aware of
the existence of your Original Conscious Mind and saw the trait of continuity
through it, and still you strove with it—you fought it.You did not let it have
the last word, you told it that it had to walk hand in hand with the brain or
else they will not progress, and you prevailed—you won!</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">He had
to remind Jacob of his triumph over the brain as well, but the existence of the
brain is an obvious thing, for who is unaware of his own realistic brain? But
the conscious mind—not everyone acknowledge it, and not everyone can identify
its trait of continuity, so the author settles with mentioning the mind, since
if Jacob defeated the mind he had surely defeated the brain as well.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">But you
were victorious, not because you have &#160;striven
with the mind (and you have&#160; striven with
the brain as well), but because you have striven with God (the Conscious Mind) 
<strong>and</strong>         
with 
<strong>men</strong>         , and only then—prevailed! “Men” are the various alternative
identities that wished to see whether they had any place in Jacob’s soul, and
the current intruder represents them all.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Thus we
conclude that If Jacob would have only struggled his conscious mind, he would
have surely lost. His victory was secured only when there was no place for
another “identity” within him, i.e. when the identity he had was constructed
based on his natural tendency to let the mind and the brain walk hand in hand.
It was this identity that could fill Jacob whole and leave no room for any
other identity.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>Israel; for thou hast striven with God and with men, and
hast prevailed.</strong>          But, and this is a big “but,” when
you deviated from your natural tendency and moved it from its place, when you
have created room for more “men” that will enter and have their say, what will
they say indeed?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<em>Take
matters into your hand and start taking control over what used to be your
natural tendency, which you utilized automatically. You will start controlling
every step you take and consciously choose your desired direction at any given
moment. Control your legs decisively, command it where, when, and at what angle
to turn. Control its speed and determination; provide the exact amount of blood
to it, which you estimate it requires for the effort you demand of it. Control
your leg! Control it through the sinew of the thigh-vein! Eat the fruit of the
sinew of the thigh-vein!</em></p>                  
<p style="direction: ltr;">Therefore,
if one deviates from one’s natural tendency and creates room for more “men”
that will enter and have their say, as described above, one will suffer a limp
and one will begin crashing down—once one begins eating the fruit of the sinew
of the thigh-vein.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Now I
return to the group, “the Children of Israel,” who are gathered under the roof
of the “Israel” prototype. This group will reach the maximum mobility level
that Jacob reached when he was at his climax and named Israel, when those
people will never eat the 
<strong>fruit</strong>          of the sinew of the thigh-vein, located
at the hollow of the thigh.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">But why
is that?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>‘Because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh’</strong>         , but not just the hollow if the thigh, not just the 
<em>bone</em>         ,
because no being had a chance of hitting Jacob only in his bone.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>‘Because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh’</strong>         , so what area was that?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">
<strong>‘The
sinew of the thigh-vein’</strong>         , the sinew was injured and
then he collapsed.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">The religious
people of our current and past generations were cautious not to eat the fruit
of the sinew of the thigh-vein, and the question is—is this why we are named
“Children of Israel”? Will we stop being Israelis if we eat the sinew of the
thigh-vein?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">They say
that Rabi Zion Levi (RIP), the Chief Rabi of Panama where I live today, was an
expert of removing the sinew of the thigh-vein from the slaughtered beasts. I
wish to use his example to answer the very real question that I have asked so
cynically above: if we would continue to eat the sinew of the thigh-vein, and
did not extract it from slaughtered beasts, we will not have reached today the
original term of the sinew of the thigh-vein and the original message it holds?
The sinew of the thigh-vein, which we have extracted from flesh for generation,
was a guiding light to us and led us to where we are today. This religious
decree, which we have kept for generations, was like a mule carrying the
original message on its back straight to us, through centuries and generations.
</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">Let us
return to our original terms, so we will not get lost: the original sinew of
the thigh-vein from the Torah and the original Children of Israel. The sons of
Jacob and his extended family will eat the direct fruit of the sinew of the
thigh-vein in the future. They still have something of the ancient Israel, for
they are the sons of Jacob, who has reached the top and controlled his brain
and Original Conscious Mind together; but he also crashed eventually and was
lost between the rock of the mind and the hard place of his brain. And his
children will also eat the sinew of the thigh-vein after him, and will
(allegedly) control their minds and brains; at times they will follow the
former, at other times they will obey the latter (whose path seems oh so
clear). And to this day, we enjoy the fruit of the sinew of the thigh-vein and
(allegedly) control our mind and brain, separately. Once we turn here, next we
turn there—one group goes to either direction. Our conflicts with ourselves are
clear, conflicts between lefties and righties, religious and secular, but we
are all wise, enlightened, and smart. We produce news for the entire world to
follow.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">While we
are grammatically called Israelis, the Children of Israel, we are so far from
this title because our current mind does not reside on the demographic area of
Israel—not in death and not in life. Nevertheless, we still have something of
Israel within us, a scent you cannot get rid of, which reminds us of the
misleading perception of the term before we explained and understood it.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">This is
the summary of our misled perception: I phrased it myself in the beginning,
before the chapter about Jacob and the intruder, before interpreting it
thoroughly. Israel, I wrote, was the man Jacob, who struggled to control his
mind. He was a relentless man who did not rely on anything—not even his own
conscious mind. He was a restless man, who did not accept anything. The man was
at a constant struggle with himself—let alone his surroundings. For this he will
pay throughout the entire history of him and his future generations. Do you
remember the times we have paid for that?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">We
strongly express the inner struggle within us, but cannot identify its source.
Each of us is so righteous about his position, and in fact, each of us is right
about his position, but the Jews express their position in a most decisive,
absolute, and deep manner. This is what stuck with us from the old term of
Israel and it is very difficult to get rid of. We cannot even identify the source
of our persistence in our positions and righteous ways, but now we can at least
identify the source of the obsessive decisiveness, even if only grammatically.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Thus,
our problem is the eternal struggle we inherited from our forefathers—the
struggle between our brains and minds. Our minds recognize the continuum of
links in space quite well, and transmit this sequence live twenty-four-seven,
every evening, morning and noon, during work hours and rest time, in war and
peace, when we stop to eat and even when we sleep.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">Our
principles, which navigate this broadcast and are affect by it, are very clear
to us; but we are always wrong to attribute them to reality; it is the only
world we 
<em>know</em>         , but they do not belong there. They belong to the world of
the conscious mind, which identifies the sequence of information links and
transmits the images to us. We receive them but maintain our claims that they
belong to the world of reality, even though it is plain to see that they do
not. The realistic brain often rejects these principles, sometimes completely
and entirely.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">This is
the matter of things with political parties in Israel: the lefties and the
righties. The principles are very clear, but those who maintain them are
confused: how can others not see what I see so clearly and how can I explain
what I see.</p>          
<p style="direction: ltr;">On the
other hand, every principle has its realistic opposition. The brain immediately
ignores the broadcast of the mind, to the point where it snatches its
metaphysical video camera and also broadcasts live every moment, in sleep, war,
work, and meals. But with this broadcast we are not confused, and we can
express ourselves eloquently. The realistic concepts are easier to phrase. But
we cannot stop wondering: how can they not side with my realistic expression?
Why would they reject it? Do I even speak their language, and do they speak
mine?</p>         
<p style="direction: ltr;">These
are the remnants of the old term Israel that linger in us and make off with it.
Our brains and minds are at constant conflict, they embarrass us and do not
leave us be—alone or in company. We constantly struggle with ourselves and the
world assumes that we mean it.
