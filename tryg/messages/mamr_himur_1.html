<div class='drk'>STATE LOTTERY ñ ENTERTAINMENT OR EXPLOITATION?<br /> <br />Is it ethical to promote lottery tickets?<br /> <br />Q. I work for a state lottery. Sometimes I wonder if we are taking unfair<br />advantage of our customersí dreams of riches. RDV<br /> <br />A. Your question is a common one. What makes it complex is that lotteries,<br />like other gambling games, mean different things to different people.<br /> <br />For some people, gambling is a form of entertainment. Just like some<br />people play cards for fun and introduce stakes just to make things<br />interesting, so some people enjoy testing their luck and look at the<br />jackpot as a way of adding excitement. For these people, gambling losses<br />belong to their recreation budget. Thatís not morally objectionable. One<br />person who has a dollar to throw away puts four quarters into a video<br />game; another has more fun investing in a Powerball ticket.<br /> <br />A few people gamble in order to lose. They want to show off how much money<br />they have. While such conspicuous consumption is certainly objectionable,<br />the business providing the service is not necessarily to blame.<br /> <br />Some people even have a charitable intention. They know that income from<br />state lotteries goes to worthy causes, and the possibility of winning is<br />only a little incentive. The administrators of one popular lottery system<br />claim that the profits go to the following good causes: mass<br />transportation in Arizona; education in Connecticut; economic development<br />in Kansas; natural resources in Minnesota; school aid and crime control in<br />Montana, etc.<br /> <br />But there are a significant number of individuals who perceive gambling as<br />a viable road to riches. They play the lottery because they feel they<br />could use the money -- oblivious to the research that shows that winning a<br />jackpot is more than likely to make their lives miserable. (This is called<br />ìsudden wealth syndrome.î) What they could really use is the precious few<br />dollars they are throwing away on tickets. Selling tickets to these poor<br />souls is improper. According to Jewish law, it borders on theft. <br /> <br />If these disappointed dreamers constitute a significant fraction of your<br />business, or alternatively if advertising is deliberately directed at<br />them, then you are taking advantage of them. You should try and find out<br />what the numbers are and take a careful look at the advertising campaign<br />for your state lottery.<br /> <br />At a deeper level, a person should recognize that there is something<br />fundamentally phony about gambling. We can learn this from the saintly<br />Rabbi Aryeh Levine of Jerusalem, of blessed memory. Rabbi Aryeh merited<br />seeing many miracles performed for him, and someone once asked him why he<br />never bought lottery tickets. He gave a surprising answer: ìIím afraid I<br />might win.î A person with a truly enlightened perspective doesnít even<br />desire unearned riches -- especially if he or she recalls the words of our<br />Sages, which are confirmed by current research: ìThe more possessions, the<br />more worry.î<br /> <br />SOURCES: Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat 34:16, Yoreh Deah 151; Mishna<br />Avot 2:7.<p><br />For more information on the Jewish Ethicist, or to read previous columns,<br />visit www.jewishethicist.com<p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />To unsubscribe, e-mail: ethicist-unsubscribe@besr.org<br />For additional commands, e-mail: ethicist-help@besr.org<br />
