<p>The purpose of this paper is to develop a novel income tax system, that will eliminate the motivation to hide incomes.</p>  
<p>The main idea is: instead of taxing the income directly, there will be a public-service duty, but the state will sell exemptions in an auction. People will have an incentive to buy an exemption for the actual sum of money that they think they can earn in the public-service. This will yield a proportional income tax system.</p>  
<p>This is only a preliminary idea. There are several issues with this idea, that I hope you can solve.</p>  
<p>Let's take a concrete example. 
<br /></p>  
<p>Suppose the government wants to have a proportional income tax of 50% (Note that it is easy to make this system progressive, by adding a demogrant or a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen%27s_dividend" title="Citizen's dividend">Citizen's dividend</a>. In this paper we will focus on the proportional component).</p>  
<p>The government declares that, in the coming month, everyone must work in a civil service for 2 weeks.</p>  
<p>However, only 10% of the population are really needed, so the government sells exemptions for 90% of the population. The exemptions are sold by an auction.</p>  
<p>Now, everyone can do the math: "If I do a civil service for 2 weeks - I lose about half of my monthly income. So, I prefer to pay half of my monthly income to buy an exemption".</p>  
<p>If everyone thinks that way, we get an excellent tax system. We do not need to check how much each person earns! They will do the calculation themselves, because it is in their own interests! This will make the tax system much more efficient, just and simple.</p> 
<p>
<div class="advanced">
<h2>Progressive variation</h2> 
<p>One may claim that this system is not progressive. Furthermore, the 
10% with the lowest income (the lower decile) will have to work in civil
 service, which seems unfair.</p> We can solve these problems easily by adding a demogrant - divide part of the taxes evenly among all citizens. This will make the tax system progressive. Additionally, since the lowest decile will not pay any tax, they will get to keep all the demogrant to themselves, so they may actually earn a lot with this system. Full analysis of the social effects of this proposal is beyond the scope of this paper.
<br />
<h2>Random variation</h2> 
<p>One may claim that this is inefficient to have 10% half-time workers, and that it is more efficient to have 5% full-time workers. We can achieve this easily by adding a random component: pick AT RANDOM 5% of the population, that 
will work for 100% of the time.</p> 
<p>We can still sell 90% exemptions. This means that 10% of the population will enter the lottery, and each one of them will have a 50% chance of winning an exemption. All calculations will be the same as above, assuming that people are risk-neutral. Full analysis of the effects of risk-attitude is beyond the scope of this paper.
<br /></p></div></p>   
<br />The main problem with this method is that, like in any auction, people will NOT offer the maximum sum that they are willing to pay - they will try to offer the minimum sum that is still high enough to win. 
<p>We can do a generalized 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction" title="Vickrey auction">Vickrey auction</a>. In this case, bidders will bid their true value (50% of their monthly income), but, the government will  get much less - about 50% of the highest income of the lower decile. 
<br /></p> 
<p>Can we change the tax policy, in order to give an incentive to everyone, to pay 50% of their real income?
<p></p>  
<p>
<div class="advanced">
<h2>Numeric variation</h2> What happens if we change the numbers? For example, instead of taking 10% of the people for 50% of the time, we can take 50% of the people for 10% of the time. We will have the same total work-force (as mentioned above, we can  pick 5% of them at random and employ them full time). In this case, the 50% with the higher income will probably bid 10% of the highest income of the 5th decile. Is it more or less than the previous scheme? Let's check:
<br /><ul>
<li>In the first case, we have 0.9 of the population pay 0.5 of the 
highest income of the lower decile. In Israel 2006, this was 2800 NIS, 
so in total we have 0.9*0.5*2800 = 1260 times the working population, 
which is about 5 billion NIS.
<br /></li> 
<li>In the second case, we have 0.5 of the population pay 0.1 of the 
highest income of the 5th decile. In Israel 2006, this was about 9000, 
so in total we have 0.1*0.5*9000 = 450 times the population, about 1.6 
billion NIS.&nbsp;</li></ul> It is interesting to check, what portion of workers should
 the government take, and for what time, in order to get the maximum tax
 revenues, for a constant work-force.
<p>In any case, this is much less than we need (about 200 billion).
<br />
<h2>Grouping variation</h2> 
<p>(needs more work).
<br />
</p> 
<p>What happens if we do the auction in groups? For example, we can do an auction Qaesaria, and a separate auction in Pardes Hanna. Probably, the lower decile in Qaesaria earns  more than the lower decile in Pardes Hanna, so we can expect to have a higher tax revenue. However, this opens the door to "tax planning", for example, changing the declared address just to pay a lower tax.</p> 
<p>Another option is to group people by height. It is known that higher people earn, in average, more than lower people, so we can get more revenue from the higher group. 
<br /></p> 
<h2>Gradual variation</h2> 
<p>(needs more work).
<br />
</p> 
Instead of selling 90% identical exemptions, we can sell groups of different exemptions:
<br /><ul>
<li>10% full exemptions - those who get these exemptions need not work at all.
<br /></li> 
<li>10% exemptions from 90% of the work - those who get these exemptions, pay only 90% of their bid, but also get only 90% exemption - they will still have to work 5% of the time.</li> 
<li>etc...</li></ul> 
<p>This way, people in the higher decile will have an incentive to pay at least the maximum amount in the 9th decile, in order to get a full exemption.
